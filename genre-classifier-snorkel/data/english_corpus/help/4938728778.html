 CareerDemon - for careers advice and guidance using psychometric tests to help you choose a career Just click on the questions below to get the information you need. A text-only version of this page is available for printing. Technical stuff What hardware and software do I need? Is it all online or can I run it on a local PC? What if I don't have local disk storage to keep my files between sessions? What about my phone bill? My keyboard skills are poor - does that matter? The mechanics of CareerDemon How many tests do I have to take? How long will it all take? So I don't have to do it all at one go? Is it very difficult? Can I retake a test if I'm not happy with it? I have a dyslexia - will this affect my ability to do the tests? How confidential are my answers to the tests? I don't have formal qualifications such as GCSEs or GNVQs. Can I still take the assessments? English isn't my first language. Will this have an effect? I'm not as young as many people who may be taking these tests. Is that going to matter at all? How about gender, racial origin, and cultural or economic background? Do these affect anything? How much does it cost - and what do I get for it? What does the report contain? What if I do the tests but don't buy the report? Psychometrics and career stuff What is psychometric testing, and how can it help with career advice? How is CareerDemon better than the rest? Is CareerDemon all I'll need, or are there other things I should be doing? Is it possible to cheat? How similar is CareerDemon to the tests that employers use? Technical stuff What hardware and software do I need? CareerDemon runs on any PC with Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT4.0 or Windows 2000. You'll need an Internet connection, but you don't have to be on line all the time. Return to top Is it all online or can I run it on a local PC? We deliver the assessment battery a test at a time to your local PC so you only have to be connected long enough for us to download. Download times will vary according to connection speeds and local conditions, but we target to complete the initial download of the test engine in less than 4 minutes - just long enough for you to get a cup of coffee, not long enough to get bored! Once you've downloaded the engine you don't have to connect again till you've completed each assessment stage, so the assessments aren't affected by connection speeds or other variables. At the end of each test the engine will upload the results and download the next test - but in most cases that should only take a few seconds. Return to top What if I don't have local disk storage to keep my files between sessions? That's OK. Your answers and the data needed to manage the assessments will be stored at CareerDemon's secure site. We keep track of where you're up to so all you have to do is log on and we'll download the tests exactly as they were when you last logged off. Or you can copy your files to a single floppy disk and restart from there. Return to top What about my phone bill? As you only connect for the period of the downloads - and they're fast - you don't have to worry about huge bills for long internet connections. Return to top My keyboard skills are poor - does that matter? All the assessments are operated by point and click with a mouse, so your level of keyboard skills doesn't matter. Return to top The mechanics of CareerDemon How many tests do I have to take? There are up to nine tests. Some of the tests will be applicable to everyone, but some will only be recommended if they seem appropriate to you. The tests are designed to assess a range of aptitudes such as numeracy, verbal ability, logical reasoning, and your comprehension and ability to follow technical directions. In addition, we check for your level of understanding and comprehension of English, your preferences in terms of working environment, occupational interests and other factors that may affect your choice of career. Return to top How long will it all take? We would expect that it will take between 3 and 5 hours for most people depending on how quickly you work. There are no time limits on the tests, so you can work as quickly or slowly as you choose. To get the most accurate results, you should work in the style that suits you best. We strongly recommend that you don't try and do all the tests in one sitting. It would probably be too much all at one go - and the inevitable tiredness you'd experience might affect your ability to do well on the tests anyway. Return to top So I don't have to do it all at one go? No. You can take as much time as you need, break off at any stage and when you come back the system will automatically restart where you left off. In fact we strongly recommend that you take it in chunks of an hour or so with breaks in between. Return to top Is it very difficult? This is heavy-duty stuff. There are lots of simple tests on the web that claim to be able to give career or personality advice, but if they don't stretch you to your limits they can't really work. CareerDemon is certainly intended to be challenging and to push you all the way. As a result you can expect that there will be things you won't be able to do. However there is nothing which is "pass/fail", there's no competitive element, and not completing some questions or sections is pretty much normal. We've tried though to make the tests interesting, and even fun - we don't want you getting bored! It would make sense to do the tests in a quiet environment where you can concentrate without much distraction or interruption. Also bear in mind that it's not like an exam, there's no preparation or revision needed. Return to top Can I retake a test if I'm not happy with it? You can retake whole modules, but not immediately, otherwise you'll still have too much residual memory of your first answers, and the results would not be dependable. In fact, it could be quite useful for you to retake the tests every two or three years during your career, as your views on working life, and your capabilities in some areas, will probably change over time. Return to top I have a dyslexia - will this affect my ability to do the tests? There are no time limits to the tests so you can take them at your own pace. We recommend in any case that you split the tests up and do not attempt to complete them all at one go or your concentration will certainly suffer. All we'd say is that the instructions for some of the tests can be quite complex so just take your time and make sure you've understood them thoroughly before you start. Return to top How confidential are my answers to the tests? The CareerDemon software and the storage of your answers on your local disk are encrypted, and the data kept by CareerDemon is held at a secure site. The only access to your tests is via your own login password so, as long as you keep that to yourself, no-one else should be able to gain access. Return to top I don't have formal qualifications such as GCSEs or GNVQs. Can I still take the assessments? The tests are designed so that there are no formal qualifications or prerequisites needed. You will still be able to take most, if not all, of the tests, and get valuable career guidance at the end. Return to top English isn't my first language. Will this have an effect? The instructions for each test are quite straightforward so they shouldn't be a problem, although some of the background data presented for the later tests can be quite complex. However, the assessment itself will measure your level of ability with written English so we can take this into account. Return to top I'm not as young as many people who may be taking these tests. Is that going to matter at all? Not at all. What we are looking for is your interest and ability in various areas that are relevant to finding a suitable career. This concept is applicable at any age whenever you may be thinking of starting a new career direction. Return to top How about gender, racial origin, and cultural or economic background? Do these affect anything? CareerDemon has been designed by a team of psychologists who have developed techniques over many years to eliminate, as far as possible, these kinds of effects. It's designed to open up possibilities for you, not stereotype you. Return to top How much does it cost - and what do I get for it? Downloading and doing the tests are absolutely free! We want you to see just how comprehensive they are before you have to pay anything. Of course there may be phone or internet connection charges, depending on how you access the Internet. When you've completed the tests and you've seen that the assessment will be worthwhile, then there is a charge of â‚¤ 55.00, to get the report. You can pay by credit or debit card online via our secure web site using Visa, Mastercard, Switch, JCB or Solo. Return to top What does the report contain? It gives you a complete run-down on your occupational interests and preferences, your aptitudes for different kinds of work, and how these combine to suggest appropriate career opportunities. Then we suggest a number of careers you might like to consider, pointing out which features of your performance in the tests are particularly relevant. Finally we will help you investigate these career options by suggesting places you can go to find out more about them. Return to top What if I do the tests but don't buy the report? Then there is nothing to pay. We'll keep your test results on file for you though, so you can come back and buy the report at a later date if you want. Return to top Psychometrics and career stuff What is psychometric testing, and how can it help with career advice? Psychometrics is the part of of psychology that is concerned with the measurement and interpretation of psychological variables such as aptitudes for different kinds of jobs. Traditionally, the application of psychometric testing to careers advice or recruitment has been on the basis of measuring &quot;intelligence&quot; or &quot;personality&quot;. CareerDemon uses much more advanced and subtle tests to give guidance on what type of career may be appropriate, and enjoyable, for each individual. Return to top How is CareerDemon better than the rest? CareerDemon has a range of professionally-designed tests for aptitudes such as numeracy, verbal ability, logical and deductive skills, and the ability to comprehend and follow complex technical instructions. It also checks your level of understanding of English, your preferences for the sort of attributes your job should have, occupational interests and other factors that are relevant to your career choice. For most people, there isn't just one perfect career, but a number of careers that may be suitable, enjoyable and satisfying. The report suggests the career options that are most likely to engage your interest and make use of your abilities. Of course, there may well be other factors to take into account. We can't test your aptitude for being a Premier League footballer or a ballet dancer on a PC. Return to top Is CareerDemon all I'll need, or are there other things I should be doing? CareerDemon will come up with potential careers that you may want to consider. You should then choose a short list of those that attract you the most and find out more about them. We can't, for example, measure your physical suitability for a particular career. We'll try to give you help on where to go to get further information, such as industry associations or training organisations. Return to top Is it possible to cheat? Most of the tests are designed so you have to follow a logical process to arrive at an answer. So, as long as you're doing the tests by yourself without anyone else helping, there isn't the possibility of cheating. Some of the tests require you to give answers in the form of preferences, and of course there's nothing to stop you lying. But why would you want to? There is no pass/fail or competitive element to the tests, and giving incorrect answers isn't going to help you find a career! Return to top How similar is CareerDemon to the tests that employers use? In fact many of the tests used by employers were developed by Dr Steve Blinkhorn, a world authority on psychometric testing and head of CareerDemon's team. CareerDemon is the newest of these developments and embodies the latest thinking in psychometric testing and career advice. Return to top Terms and conditions for use of this site

<tr><td class="regTxt">Psychometrics is the part of of psychology that is concerned with the measurement and interpretation of psychological variables such as aptitudes for different kinds of jobs.<br><br>Traditionally, the application of psychometric testing to careers advice or recruitment has been on the basis of measuring &quot;intelligence&quot; or &quot;personality&quot;. CareerDemon uses much more advanced and subtle tests to give guidance on what type of career may be appropriate, and enjoyable, for each individual.</td><tr>

<tr><td class="regTxt">CareerDemon has a range of professionally-designed tests for aptitudes such as numeracy, verbal ability, logical and deductive skills, and the ability to comprehend and follow complex technical instructions. It also checks your level of understanding of English, your preferences for the sort of attributes your job should have, occupational interests and other factors that are relevant to your career choice.<br><br>For most people, there isn't just one perfect career, but a number of careers that may be suitable, enjoyable and satisfying. The report suggests the career options that are most likely to engage your interest and make use of your abilities. Of course, there may well be other factors to take into account. We can't test your aptitude for being a Premier League footballer or a ballet dancer on a PC.</td><tr>

<tr><td class="regTxt">Most of the tests are designed so you have to follow a logical process to arrive at an answer. So, as long as you're doing the tests by yourself without anyone else helping, there isn't the possibility of cheating. Some of the tests require you to give answers in the form of preferences, and of course there's nothing to stop you lying. But why would you want to? There is no pass/fail or competitive element to the tests, and giving incorrect answers isn't going to help you find a career!</td><tr>
