 AdviceJoe.com - Advice on love, sex, work, or play November 15, 2003 ** Happy Holidays ** Welcome to AdviceJoe.com Free no-nonsense Advice on love, sex, work or play. Thank you for continuing to visit and support AdviceJoe.com!! --Joe Dear Joe- I am involved with this guy who is 20 years old. We are engaged. When we first met, we had the greatest relationship we could ever want. The sex was great. We tried many different things to keep it exciting. Well this last month, it has completely changed. It is like I have to plan when we are going to have sex and tell him about it. Well, it went from that to him totally avoiding me in anyway sexually. He is not affectionate nor wants any sex. If I try, he tries to avoid it period. Last night for instance I told him that I wanted it. He stayed up till 5AM in the morning and when he came to bed, he rolled over. I'm talking it went from sex 5 to 6 times a week to 1 time every three to four weeks. I don't understand. When I talk to him about it, it's like he avoids the question. I feel like I am being totally turned away. This is a big deal. I have gotten to the point to where I don't care anymore but, at the same time, I love him. But, I don't want my relationship to be like this. Please help me here what could be going on? What do I need to do? --Don't want to say 31 Don't want to say- I think he is seeing someone else or, his attraction to you has changed. There is something going on in his head. He is avoiding you in every way. No communication, no sex, and he is 21. You need to get to the bottom of the problem. Whatever you do, do not marry him until you know the whole truth. It will probably end your relationship but, you need to know. Do not take no for an answer. Pen him down and make him answer your questions. --Joe Dear Joe- I like sexual activity with flies. I like the feel of flies on my body on legs and penis, but I some times feel guilty when I buy maggots. It is the feeling of people knowing what I do makes me excited. Especially when I talk to people who I do not know about it. I also like masturbating when people call me names. I wonder If you know any one who would call me names like idiot and stupid moron? --Colin 45 Colin- I will call you stupid and a moron if you want because I think you are. I know fetishes are just that but, maggots and flies are so dirty. You could get so sick from it. Please be careful. --Joe Dear Joe- My husband has expressed a desire for me to get on top during sex but, I'm not sure exactly what he wants me to do. He has much more experience than me. I was a virgin until I met him. I'm wondering if you could give me some tips. --Katherine 19 Katherine- He wants you to take control. You will control the thrusts and the speed of your love making. Doing so should heighten your sexual pleasure. Also, it is less work for him. But, he also gets to enjoy the feeling of you controlling him. It feels good to let someone else take control sometimes. Just climb on and start riding. --Joe Dear Joe- Is it normal for a straight guy to watch gay porn? I started seeing this guy who seems to joke a little too much about &quot;gay things&quot;. The first time was when he had asked his roommate if he can watch him shower. He just laughed and said his roommate told him to get out of here! I thought he was joking until now. Today, he told me that he has watched gay porn too. I am really tripping out on this because I don't know what to think. It took me by surprise and now I am totally dwelling on it. I asked him if he ever had sex with a man and he said no. I just don't know what to do or say. Please advise! I have no problem with gay men. My best friend is gay. It's just weird and has never happened to me. Thanks. PS.. I asked him if he is bi-sexual and he said no! What the heck does this all mean, do you know? --Jen 30 Jen- It sounds like your friend does not know what he is. He is exploring his sexuality and trying a little of the &quot;gay thing.&quot; In my opinion he is gay but, not sure. I would not fall for this guy because he sounds gay or, he will come out to you very soon. Or if you fall for him and get involved, he might be the type of guy to cheat on you with men and come home to you. It is very common these days for this to happen. You must be careful. --Joe Dear Joe- My question is if the man you love, the man that says he loves you and has for 4.5 years is having an emotional struggle inside of himself and without a word of warning, has stopped calling me after calling me 8 times a day for 4.5 years. Should I give him the space he apparently needs to work it out inside of himself or, should I call him and ask him what is going on? Why he isn't calling me? He didn't tell me he wasn't going to call anymore-- he just isn't calling. Thanks. --Sandy 44 Sandy- I would call and ask him if there is anything you can do to help and tell him that you are concerned. That is the best way to approach this situation. You don't want to offend him or cause anymore stress. Just let him know that you are concerned and that you are here if he needs you. That is true love. --Joe Dear Joe- Is there any disadvantages of masturbating every night? Do I loose any nutrition, minerals or vitamins? If there is, please let me know and also how often a person should masturbate? Thank you. -- Pal 24 Pal- You don't lose anything from masturbating and it does not matter often you do it. It actually burn calories and feels great. --Joe Dear Joe- I had a crush on a girl in junior high school and we talked but nothing happened. I found out later that she liked me in high school. Well years later, we met through on-line source and agreed to meet. I picked her up, went to a bar, came home and ended up spending the night with her. We didn't have sex but, before I left, she asked if she could call me later that night. I said yes but she never called. I don't know what to think or what she is thinking and would like some advice on this matter. Please, my mind needs to take a break from spinning. --Chris 26 Chris- She probably liked you in high school before you became the man that you are now. Now, that she has met the man, she does not have the same feelings she did before. It happens with a lot of high school crushes. As soon as you really get to know them, it's just not that fun. I am not saying you are a bad guy or something, you guys just did not hit it off . --Joe Dear Joe- I just wanted to say I love your site it gives people a chance to get things off their minds. Well I noticed a bump on my pubic area and I think it might be an ingrown hair, its red, and sensitive and showed up over night. Well I never had sex before and wanted to know if it can be some kind of infection or rash. If you can get back to me soon that would be great. Thank you for your time. -- Sandy 16 Sandy- If you have not had and intimate contact with anyone, you have nothing to worry about. People get ingrown hairs all the time. It will go away on its own. --Joe Dear Joe- I need some advice! My boyfriend of 4 years, who is 23, seems to have an addiction to porn. I confront him in a calm manner about it to let him know that it does bother me to see that on his computer. He told me he would stop and he hasn't. I know that we all have our fantasies, but this is getting ridiculous! It also wouldn't be such a big deal if he just showed me a little bit of affection. There seems to be no sexual passion at all. I don't think he has French kissed me in almost a year! I try to fix that problem, but he's always too tired or it's something else. Help me, Joe! It's starting to really really agitate me! Thanks in Advance! --Desi 19 Desi- There's something rotten going on here. If you are feeling neglected at all with his porn addiction, then you need to set up some rules. If he does not stop and show you so attention, then you should sit there and watch it with him. Sit next to him on the computer until he stops. If he is like me, I cannot stand someone watching me surf the net. That will start to give him the message that you are not happy and you mean business. Once you start sexual advances, do not take no for an answer. Push the issue as far as you can without being mean. Being mean is a big turn off. It will take some work but, start now. --Joe Dear Joe- I am in love with a girl who is the same age as me. She told her mother about our relationship. Her mother did not like our relationship because according to her, if eldest children of a family get married, problems will occur. We are in the Hindu religion. The girl said to me it is better we become friends. I really cannot accept this. I really do not have the strength to live anymore. Please help me. I have made a decision to commit suicide if things cannot be worked out as I planned. I really want to marry her. --Vadivelan 22 Vadivelan- Suicide is not the answer to your problems. Her mother's beliefs are old and not based on fact. Why don't you become friend with her first at let her mother see how good you are together. Maybe she will change her mind about your relationship. Killing yourself will solve nothing. You will be dead and she will still be alone. --Joe Dear Joe- You sound like me, when you are telling the ones that are young to slow down. How true. I sure I wished I had. I am 38 and so much had gone by that I wished I had not over looked. Life is short and you must take the time to enjoy it. For the next day is not promised to you. The other thing is I have a spelling disorder. With good reason, I was sick with high temp and made me have a hard time with some of the smallest things in life. (such as my spelling) I do not let this get me down and I keep going on with life. I do not care to what other think of me. I do know that a lot of good women passed up a good man due to my (dumbness). I am far from being dumb. I had to be in learning disability classes to help me in school but I am here to ask you to let others know that we all have our down and out times in some way and do not pass judgment on others. I am happy to say that I was taken from a mother and dad that did not care for me and was given to a mom and dad that does love me and care for me. No matter to how bad my spelling may be. They were always there for me and now it is just dad and I. Mom passed 7 mouths ago and we are okay. I had my own business and done very good of making it a good one and sold it. Now, I am working on a new one to keep and pass it down to my son. Just because one has some kind of hardship as you will say or call it, get to know the person then make up your mind of them. Thank you. --Larry in Oklahoma 38 Larry- Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. If more people felt they why you do, the world would be a better place. --Joe Dear Joe- Do you think it's right to tell a man how many sexual partners you had? --Mel 30 Mel- If you want to be completely honest with them, then yes. But, if you have had an unusually amount of sex partners, you might not want to disclose the entire amount. You don't want to give the man a heart attack. --Joe The First Annual Sex Issue Click Here The Second Annual Sex Issue Click Here The Third Annual Sex Issue Click Here Dear Joe- I am tired of getting rejected when I try to get him in the mood. He complains about his stomach... Click Here Dear Joe, Love is Blind.

Dear Joe-<br>
I am involved with
this guy who is 20 years old. We are engaged. When we first met,&nbsp; we had the
greatest relationship we could ever want. The sex was great. We tried
many different things to keep it exciting. Well this last month,&nbsp;
it has completely changed. It is like I have to plan when we are going to have
sex and tell him about it. Well, it went from that to him totally avoiding
me in
anyway sexually. He is not affectionate nor wants any sex. If I try, he tries to
avoid it period. Last night for instance I told him that I wanted it. He stayed
up
till 5AM&nbsp; in the morning and when he came to bed,&nbsp; he rolled over. I'm talking it
went from sex 5 to 6 times a week to 1 time every three to four weeks. I don't
understand. When I talk to him about it,&nbsp; it's like he avoids the question.&nbsp;
I
feel like I am being totally turned away. This is a big
deal.&nbsp; I have gotten to the point to where I don't care anymore but,&nbsp; at the same
time, I love him. But,&nbsp; I don't want my relationship to be like this. Please
help me
here what could be going on? What do I need to do?<br>

 Don't want to say-&nbsp;<br>
 I think he is seeing someone else or, his attraction to you
 has changed. There is something going on in his head. He is avoiding you in
 every way. No communication, no sex, and he is 21. You need to get to the
 bottom of the problem. Whatever you do, do not marry him until you know the
 whole truth. It will probably end your relationship but, you need to know. Do
 not take no for an answer. Pen him down and make him answer your questions.&nbsp;<br>
 --Joe</p>

Dear Joe-<br>
I like
sexual activity with flies. I like the feel of flies on my body on legs and
penis, but I some times feel guilty when I buy maggots. It is the feeling of
people knowing what I do makes me excited. Especially when I talk to people who
I do not know about it. I also like masturbating when people call me names. I wonder If you
know any one who would call me names like idiot and stupid moron?<br>

 I will call you stupid and a moron if you want because I think you are.&nbsp; I know fetishes are just
 that but, maggots and flies are so dirty. You could get so sick from it. Please
 be careful.<br>

Dear Joe-<br>
My husband has expressed a
desire for me to get on top during sex but,&nbsp; I'm not sure exactly what he wants me
to do. He has much more experience than me. I was a virgin until I met him. I'm
wondering if you could give me some tips.<br>

 He wants you to take control. You will control the thrusts and the
 speed of your love making. Doing so should heighten your sexual pleasure. Also,
 it is less work for him. But, he also gets to enjoy the feeling of you
 controlling him. It feels good to let someone else take control sometimes. Just
 climb on and start riding.&nbsp;<br>

Dear Joe-<br>
Is it normal for a
straight guy to watch gay porn? I started seeing this guy who seems to joke a
little too much about &quot;gay things&quot;. The first time was when he had asked
his roommate if he can watch him shower. He just laughed and said his roommate told
him to get out of here! I thought he was joking until now. Today,&nbsp; he told me that
he has watched gay porn too. I am really tripping out on this because I don't
know what to think. It took me by surprise and now I am totally dwelling on
it. I asked him if he ever had sex with a man and he said no. I just don't know
what to do or say. Please advise! I have no problem with gay men. My best friend
is gay. It's just weird and has never happened to me.&nbsp; Thanks.<br>
PS.. I asked him if he is bi-sexual and he said no! What the heck does this all
mean, do you know?&nbsp;<br>
--Jen 30</p>
<p>
 <img border="0" src="../../images/advice.gif" width="270" height="20" alt="Advice"><br>
 Jen-<br>
 It sounds like your friend does not know what he is. He is exploring his
 sexuality and trying a little of the &quot;gay thing.&quot; In my opinion he is
 gay but, not sure. I would not fall for this guy because he sounds gay or, he
 will come out to you very soon.&nbsp;Or if you fall for him and get involved,
he might be the type of guy to cheat on you with men and come home to you. It is
very common these days for this to happen. You must be careful.&nbsp;<br>

Dear Joe-<br>
My question is if the man you love, the man that says he loves you and has for
4.5 years is having an emotional struggle inside of himself and without a word
of warning, has stopped calling me after calling me 8 times a day for 4.5 years.
Should I give him the space he apparently needs to work it out inside of himself
or,&nbsp; should I call him and ask him what is going on? Why he isn't calling
me? He didn't tell me he wasn't going to call anymore-- he just isn't calling.
Thanks. <br>

 I would call and ask him if there is anything you can do to help and tell him
 that you are concerned. That is the best way to approach this situation. You
 don't want to offend him or cause anymore stress. Just let him know that you
 are concerned and that you are here if he needs you. That is true love. <br>

 You don't lose anything from masturbating and it does not matter often you do

Dear Joe-<br>
I had a crush on a girl in junior high school and we talked but nothing happened. I found out later that
she liked me in high school. Well years later, we met through on-line source and
agreed to meet. I picked her up, went to a bar, came home and ended up
spending the night with her. We didn't have sex but,&nbsp; before I left,&nbsp; she asked if
she could call me later that night. I said yes but she never called. I don't
know what to think or what she is thinking and would like some advice on this
matter. Please, my mind needs to take a break from spinning.<br>

 She probably liked you in high school before you became the man that you
 are now. Now, that she has met the man, she does not have the same feelings she
 did before. It happens with a lot of high school crushes. As soon as you really
 get to know them, it's just not that fun. I am not saying you are a bad guy or
 something, you guys just did not hit it off .&nbsp;<br>

I just
wanted to say I love your site it gives people a chance to get things off their
minds. Well I noticed a bump on my pubic area and I think it might be an ingrown
hair, its red, and sensitive and showed up over night. Well I never had sex
before and wanted to know if it can be some kind of infection or rash. If you
can get back to me soon that would be great. Thank you for your time.<br>

Dear Joe-<br>
I need some advice! My boyfriend of 4 years, who is 23, seems to have
an addiction to porn. I confront him in a calm manner about it to let him know
that it does bother me to see that on his computer. He told me he would stop and
he hasn't. I know that we all have our fantasies, but this is getting
ridiculous! It also wouldn't be such a big deal if he just showed me a little
bit of affection. There seems to be no sexual passion at all. I don't think he
has French kissed me in almost a year! I try to fix that problem, but he's
always too tired or it's something else. Help me, Joe! It's starting to really really
agitate me! Thanks in Advance!&nbsp;<br>

 There's something rotten going on here. If you are feeling neglected at
 all with his porn addiction, then you need to set up some rules. If he does not
 stop and show you so attention, then you should sit there and watch it with
 him. Sit next to him on the computer until he stops. If he is like me, I cannot
 stand someone watching me surf the net. That will start to give him the message
 that you are not happy and you mean business. Once you start sexual advances,
 do not take no for an answer. Push the issue as far as you can without being
 mean. Being mean is a big turn off. It will take some work but, start now.&nbsp;<br>

I am in love
with a girl who is the same age as me. She told her mother
about our relationship. Her mother did not like our relationship because
according to her,&nbsp; if eldest children of a family get married, problems
will occur. We are in the Hindu
religion. The girl said to me it is better we become friends.
I really cannot accept this. I really do not have the strength to live anymore. Please
help me. I have made a decision to commit suicide if things cannot be worked out
as I
planned. I really want to marry her.<br>

 Suicide is not the answer to your problems. Her mother's beliefs are
 old and not based on fact. Why don't you become friend with her first at let
 her mother see how good you are together. Maybe she will change her mind about
 your relationship. Killing yourself will solve nothing. You will be dead and
 she will still be alone.&nbsp;<br>

Dear Joe-<br>
You sound like me, when you are telling the ones that are young to slow down.
How true. I sure I wished I had. I am 38 and so much had gone by that I wished I
had not over looked.&nbsp; Life is short and you must take the time to enjoy it.
For the next day is not promised to you. The other thing is I have a spelling
disorder. With good reason,&nbsp; I was sick with high temp and made me have a
hard time with some of the smallest things in life. (such as my spelling) I do
not let this get me down and I keep going on with life.&nbsp; I do not care to
what other think of me. I do know that a lot of good women passed up a good man
due to my (dumbness).&nbsp; I am far from being dumb. I had to be in learning disability
classes to help me in school but I am here to ask you to let others know that we
all have our down and out times in some way and do not pass judgment on others.
I am happy to say that I was taken from a mother and dad that did not care for
me and was given to a mom and dad that does love me and care for me. No matter
to how bad my spelling may be. They were always there for me and now it is just
dad and I. Mom passed 7 mouths ago and we are okay. I had my own business and
done very good of making it a good one and sold it. Now,&nbsp; I am working on a
new one to keep and pass it down to my son. Just because one has some kind of
hardship as you will say or call it,&nbsp; get to know the person then make up
your mind of them. Thank you. <br>

you do, the world would be a better place.<br>

Dear Joe-<br>
Do you think it's right to tell a
man how many sexual partners you had?<br>
--Mel 30&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 <img border="0" src="../../images/advice.gif" width="270" height="20" alt="Advice"><br>
 Mel-&nbsp;<br>
 If you want to be completely honest with them, then yes. But, if you have
 had an unusually amount of sex partners, you might not want to disclose the
 entire amount. You don't want to give the man a heart attack.&nbsp;<br>
