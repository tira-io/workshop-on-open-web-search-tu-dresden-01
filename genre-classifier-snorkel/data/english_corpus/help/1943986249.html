Q2 Is it better to store scripts in the cgi-bin directory or to identify them using the .cgi extension? Q3 Are compiled languages such as C safer than interpreted languages like Perl and shell scripts? Q4 I found a great CGI script on the Web and I want to install it. How can I tell if it's safe? Q5 What CGI scripts are known to contain security holes? Language Independent Issues Q6 I'm developing custom CGI scripts. What unsafe practices should I avoid? Q7 But if I avoid eval(), exec(), popen() and system(), how can I create an interface to my database/search engine/graphics package? Q8 Is it safe to rely on the PATH environment variable to locate external programs? Q9 I hear there's a package called cgiwrap that makes CGI scripts safe?
