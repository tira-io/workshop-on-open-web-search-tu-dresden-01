 Comp.dsp FAQ: DSP Books and Papers Previous section (0) Next section (2) Q1: General DSP Q1.1: Summary of DSP books and significant research articles Updated 12/17/01 Q1.1.1: Bibles of DSP theory R. E. Crochiere and L. R. Rabiner, Multirate Digital Signal Processing , Prentice-Hall, 1983, ISBN 0-13-605162-6. This book is the only real reference for filter banks and multirate systems, as opposed to being a tutorial. Peter Kootsookos notes: this book is most certainly an excellent book on multi-rate signal processing, but it came out right before perfect reconstruction filter banks hit the streets. Multirate Systems and Filter Banks by P. P. Vaidyanathan covers this issue. G. H. Golub and C. F. van Loan, Matrix Computations , Third Edition, John Hopkins University Press, 1996, ISBN 081085413-X.

Harris, "On the Use of Windows for Harmonic Analysis with the Discrete Fourier Transform", IEEE Proceedings , January 1978, pp. 51-83. Perhaps the classic overview paper for discrete-time windows. It discusses some 15 different classes of windows including their spectral responses and the reasons for their development. [Brian Evans, bevans@ece.utexas.edu] There are several typos in the above paper. The errors are corrected in: A. H. Nuttall, "Some Windows with Very Good Sidelobe Behavior," IEEE Trans. on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing , Vol. ASSP-29, No. 1, February 1981. Nezih C. Geckinli and Davras Yavuz, "Some Novel Windows and a Concise Tutorial Comparison of Window Families", IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing , Vol. ASSP-26, No. 6, December 1978. Lineu C. Barbosa, "A Maximum-Energy-Concentration Spectral Window," IBM J. Res. Develop. , Vol. 30, No. 3, May 1986, p. 321-325. An elegant method for designing a time-discrete solution for realization of a spectral window which is ideal from an energy concentration viewpoint. This window is one that concentrates the maximum amount of energy in a specified bandwidth and hence provides optimal spectral resolution. Unlike the Kaiser window, this window is a discrete-time realization having the same objectives as the continuous-time prolate spheroidal function; at the expense of not having a closed form solution. [Joe Campbell, jpcampb@afterlife.ncsc.mil] D. J. Thomson, "Spectrum Estimation and Harmonic Analysis," Proc. of the IEEE , vol. 70, no. 9, pp. 1055-1096, Sep. 1982. In his classic 1982 paper, David Thompson proposes the powerful multiple-window method, which is an elegant and robust technique for spectrum estimation. Based on the Cramer representation, Thompson's method is nonparametric, consistent, efficient, and optimally suited for finite data samples. In addition, it has excellent bias control and stability, provides an analysis of variance test for line components, and finally, works very well in many practical applications. Unfortunately, his important work has been neglected in many textbooks and graduate courses on statistical signal processing.

Wavelet Tools Description: There is a set of Wavelet Tools available for MATLAB, see Section 2.9 of this FAQ. Communications Toolbox Description: We have developed a &quot;Communications Toolbox&quot; based on the MATLAB code for classroom use. It is used by students taking a 4th year communications course where the emphasis is on digital coding of waveforms and on digital data transmission systems. The MATLAB code that constitutes this toolbox has been in use for over two years. There are close to 100 &quot;M-files&quot; that implement various functions. Some of them are quite simple and are based on existing MATLAB M-files. But a great many of them has been created from scratch. We also prepared a lab manual (in TEX format) for the 7 simulations which the students perform as the lab component of this course. The topics of these simulations are: Probability Theory Random Processes Quantization Binary Signalling Formats Detection Digital Modulation Digital Communication To obtain: M-files (MATLAB 4.2) is available in: ftp://ftp.mathworks.com/pub/contrib/v4/misc/comm_tbx/ The complete manual in Postscript format is available at ftp://ftp.mathworks.com/pub/contrib/v4/misc/comm_tbx/comm_tbx.manual.ps . [Mehmet Zeytinoglu, mzeytin@ee.ryerson.ca] Digital Filter Package (DFP) Description: The Digital Filter Package is a GUI front-end to digital filter design with MATLAB. DFP extends the basic digital filter design functionality of MATLAB in two important ways: Filter coefficients can be quantized. This feature is important if the filter is to be implemented on a fixed-point DSP processor. DFP generates assembly-language code for the designed digital filter. In the current release of DFP, this option is only available for the Motorola DSP56xxx family. For more information: http://www.ee.ryerson.ca:8080/~mzeytin/dfp/index.html .

It includes a copy of the reference manual. The only drawbacks to the student version are that the floating point coprocessor is disabled and that upgrades cannot be ordered. Signal Processing Packages (SPP) and Notebooks, Version 2.9.5 Description: Freely distributable extensions to Mathematica. Enables the symbolic manipulation of signal processing expressions: 1-D discrete/continuous convolutions and 1-D/m-D linear transforms (Laplace, Fourier, z, DTFT, and DFT). For linear transforms, you can specify your own transform pairs and see the intermediate computations. Great for showing students how to take transforms, or for deriving input-output relationships in a transform domain. Additional abilities include analog filter design, solving DE's using transforms, converting signal processing expressions to their equivalent TeX forms, number theoretic operations (Bezout numbers, Smith Form decompositions, and matrix factors), and multirate operations (graphical design of 2-d decimators). Accompanying the SPPs are tutorial notebooks on analog filter design, Fourier analysis, piecewise convolution, and the z-transform (includes a discussion of fundamentals of digital filter design). These Notebooks illustrate difficult concepts (such as the flip-and-slide view of convolution) through animation. To obtain: Contact Brian Evans at bevans@ece.utexas.edu, or see http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~bevans/projects/symbolic/spp.html . Version 3.0 of the SPP (an "overhauled version of 2.x" according to the author) is available commercially in two products: the Signals and Systems Pack from Wolfram Research, and a book entitled "Mathematica Notebooks to Accompany Contemporary Linear Systems Using MATLAB" from PWS Publishing company. EE341 Description: Dr. Roberto H. Bamberger reports: I have developed a series of about 30 Lectures that I use for EE341 (Analog Communication Systems) here at Washington State University. They use the SPP by Brian Evans. They discuss many concepts associated with linear systems theory. Topics covered include LTI system theory, convolution, AM, FM, PM modulation and demodulation, and the sampling theorem. NOTE: All Notebooks were developed under NeXTSTEP 3.1 using Mathematica 2.2. I make no guarantees about the graphics being able to be rendered on anything other than a NeXT.

Sfront Description: Sfront is a compiler for Structured Audio, the audio signal processing language that is a part of the ISO/IEC MPEG 4 Audio standard. The output of the compiler is a C program, that when compiled and executed generates the audio, with many audio input, audio output, and control options, including real-time interactive and audio streaming support for some OS's. The website also includes an online book for learning how to program in Structured Audio, and a reference manual that describes how to extend sfront and embed it in applications. Platforms: The compiler is written in strict ANSI C, and runs on most UNIX systems as well as MS Windows. To obtain: Sfront is distributed under the GNU public license, and is available for free download at the website: http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~lazzaro/sa . Shorten Description: Shorten is a compressor/coder for waveform files. It supports both lossless coding and lossy coding down to three bits per sample. It operates using a linear predictor and Huffman coding the prediction residual using Rice codes. A technical report shows that this simple scheme is both fast and near optimal. Data formats supported are RIFF WAVE plus signed and unsigned values at 8 or 16 bits per sample, ulaw, alaw and multiple interleaved channels. For lossless compression of speech files recorded using 16 bits at 16 kHz the compression ratio is typically 2:1. CD audio (44.1 kHz, 16 bit stereo) is near transparant at 4:1 or 5:1 lossy compression. Platforms: The command line version compiles on most UNIX platforms. A version is available for MS Windows/NT. To obtain: http://www.softsound.com/Shorten.html points to all versions. [Tony Robinson, ajr@softsound.com] Q1.3.5: Text to Speech Conversion Software Updated 1/7/97 Free (but not public domain) text to speech conversion software is available via anonymous ftp from wilma.cs.brown.edu in the pub directory as speak.tar.Z. It will compile and run on a SPARC's built-in audio after modifying speak.c with the path of your libaudio.h (e.g., /usr/demo/SOUND/libaudio.h). It's a simple phoneme concatenation system with commensurate synthesized speech quality (a directory of phoneme audio files is included). [Joe Campbell, jpcampb@afterlife.ncsc.mil] A public domain version of the same Naval Research Lab text to phoneme rules can be obtained from: ftp://svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/comp.speech/syntheses/english2phoneme.tar.gz The comp.speech FTP site includes a speech synthesis directory at ftp://svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/comp.speech/synthesis. The main package is "rsynth" which is a complete text to speech synthesis system. Several component packages are also present. "textnorm" converts non-words such as digit strings into words (e.g. 1000 to ONE THOUSAND). "english2phoneme" does some of the same but its main functionality is to guess an appropriate phoneme sequence for each word. "klatt" takes a parametric form that describes each phoneme and converts it to a waveform. Other packages exist in the same directory to edit and visualise the klatt parameters. [Tony Robinson, ajr@softsound.com] Q1.3.6: Filter Design Software Updated 03/30/01 There are filter design programs available via anonymous FTP. The following are summarized here and discussed in greater detail below: August 1992 IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing: METEOR FIR filter design program. DFiltFIR and DFiltInt FIR filter design program. Netlib IIR filter design. IEEE Press &quot;Programs for Digital Signal Processing&quot;. Tod Schuck's near-optimal Kaiser-Bessel program. Brian Evans' and Niranjan Damera-Venkata's packages for Matlab and Mathematica. ScopeFIR. FilterExpress. Charles Poynton's filter design resource page. Juhana Kouhia's hotlist. The August 92 issue of IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing includes a paper entitled &quot;METEOR: A Constraint-Based FIR Filter Design Program&quot; by Kenneth Steiglitz, Thomas W. Parks and James F. Kaiser. The authors describe an FIR design program which allows specification of the target frequency response characteristics in a fairly generalized and flexible way. As well as designing filters, the program can optimize filter lengths and push band limits. The source for the programs (meteor.p, form.p, meteor.c, and form.c) and the METEOR paper as a postscript file may be found at http://www. music.Princeton.edu/classes/class.html . The programs were originally written in Pascal and then evidentally run through p2c to produce the C versions; all the necessary Pascal library stuff is included in the C code and they built error-free out of the box for me on an SGI machine. There is no manual. The paper includes instructions on running the programs. [Steve Clift, clift@mail.anacapa.net] Weimin Liu has created a Windows 95 interface to the Meteor program, which can be downloaded from http://www.nyx.net/~wliu/filter.html . Other free filter design packages are DFiltFIR and DFiltInt. DFiltFIR designs minimax approximation FIR filters. It uses the algorithm developed by McClelland and Parks and incorporates constraints on the response as proposed by Grenez. DFiltInt designs minimum mean-square error FIR interpolating filters. The design specification is in terms of a tabulated power spectrum model for the input signal. The packages are available from http://www.tsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Docs/Software/FilterDesign/FilterDesign.html or directly via anonymous ftp from ftp://ftp.tsp.ece.mcgill.ca/TSP/FilterDesign/ . Another package, libtsp, is a library of C-language routines for signal processing. The package is available from http://www.tsp.ece.mcgill.ca/reports/Software/libtsp/libtsp.html or directly via anonymous ftp from ftp://ftp.tsp.ece.mcgill.ca/pub/libtsp/ [Peter Kabal, kabal@ECE.McGill.CA] Another source is netlib: &quot;A free program to design IIR Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Cauer (elliptic) filters, in any of lowpass, bandpass, band reject, and high pass configurations, is available in netlib (e.g., netlib.bell-labs.com) as the file netlib/cephes/ellf.shar.Z. By email to netlib@netlib.bell-labs.com the request message text is `send ellf from cephes'. The URL is http://www.netlib.org . [Stephen Moshier, moshier@world.std.com] The Fortran source code from the IEEE Press book &quot;Programs For Digital Signal Processing&quot; is available by anonymous ftp from ftp://soma.crl.mcmaster.ca/pub/IEEE/software/dsp.zip or ftp://soma.crl.mcmaster.ca/pub/IEEE/software/dsp.tar.gz . It includes FIR and IIR filter design software, FFT subroutines, interpolation programs, a coherence and cross-spectral estimation program, linear prediction analysis programs, and a frequency domain filtering program. There is also a C/C++ version of the McClellan-Parks-Rabiner FIR filter design program available from ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume22/fir/part01.Z This program was created and tested using Borland C++ 2.0. This requires a pretty reasonable C++ compiler - it is reported that QuickC (not C++) won't do it. [Witold Waldman, Witold.Waldman@dsto.defence.gov.au, from Charles Owen at mgcbo@uxa.ecn.bgu.au; also Andrew Ukrainec, ukrainec@InfoUkes.com] I have developed a MATLAB (vers 4.0 for Windows) program that allows for the frequency domain design of the "near optimal" Kaiser-Bessel window. The program is based upon the three closed form equations developed by Kaiser and Schafer in 1981 that allow for the specification of the time domain window length, and the frequency domain mainlobe width and relative sidelobe amplitude. For signal processing applications where the spectral content of the windowing function is critical so as not to mask adjacent spectra such as radar signal processing applications where a weak target return adjacent to a strong target return could be easily masked by a windowing function that resolves poorly in frequency; this program allows complete frequency domain specification of the spectral characteristics of the windowing function. The current version of this program allows for the user to specify the two frequency domain parameters of mainlobe width and relative sidelobe amplitude and lets the window length fall out as the dependent variable. The program is easily modified to allow for any two parameters to be selected and allowing the third to be determined as a result. This program will output to an ASCII file the window coefficients that can be easily dumped to an EPROM or included in a program. It also generates both time and frequency domain graphs so that the user can visually verify the widow record length and spectral content. I will gladly provide any interested parties with my MATLAB code. Tod M. Schuck Lockheed Martin NE&SS Moorestown, NJ 08060 e-mail: tod.m.schuck@lmco.com Filter Optimization Packages for Matlab and Mathematica, version 1.1 by Brian L. Evans and Niranjan Damera-Venkata, Dept. of ECE, The University of Texas at Austin. Available from http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~bevans/projects/filters/syn_filter_software.html . We have released a set of Matlab packages to optimize the following characteristics of analog filter designs simultaneously: magnitude response linear phase in the passband peak overshoot in the step response quality factors (Q) subject to constraints on the same characteristics. The Matlab packages take about 10 seconds for fourth-order filters and 3 minutes for eighth-order filters to run on a 167-MHz Sun Ultra-2 workstation. We use the symbolic mathematics environment Mathematica to describe the constrained non-linear optimization problem formally, derive the gradients of the cost function and constraints, and synthesize the Matlab code to perform the optimization. In the public release, we provide the Matlab to optimize analog IIR filters of fourth, sixth, and eighth orders. Using the Mathematica formulation, designers can add new measures and constraints, such as capacitance spread for integrated circuit layout, and regenerate the Matlab code. We describe the framework in [1]. An earlier version of the framework is described in [2]. We plan to extend this framework to digital IIR filters. [1] N. Damera-Venkata, B. L. Evans, M. D.

with MATLAB. DFP extends the basic digital filter design functionality of MATLAB in two
important ways:<p>
<ul>
<li>Filter coefficients can be quantized. This feature is important if the filter is to be
implemented on a fixed-point DSP processor.
<li>DFP generates assembly-language code for the designed digital filter. In the current release
of DFP, this option is only available for the Motorola DSP56xxx family.

<dt><h4>Signal Processing Packages (SPP) and Notebooks, Version 2.9.5</h4><dd>

<dt>Description:<dd>Freely distributable extensions to Mathematica.
Enables the symbolic manipulation of signal processing expressions: 1-D
discrete/continuous convolutions and 1-D/m-D linear transforms
(Laplace, Fourier, z, DTFT, and DFT).  For linear transforms,
you can specify your own transform pairs and see the
intermediate computations. Great for showing students how to
take transforms, or for deriving input-output relationships in
a transform domain.  Additional abilities include analog
filter design, solving DE's using transforms, converting
signal processing expressions to their equivalent TeX forms,
number theoretic operations (Bezout numbers, Smith Form
decompositions, and matrix factors), and multirate operations
(graphical design of 2-d decimators).  Accompanying the SPPs
are tutorial notebooks on analog filter design, Fourier
analysis, piecewise convolution, and the z-transform (includes
a discussion of fundamentals of digital filter design).  These
Notebooks illustrate difficult concepts (such as the
flip-and-slide view of convolution) through animation.

<a href=http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~bevans/projects/symbolic/spp.html>

<p>
Version 3.0 of the SPP (an "overhauled version of 2.x" according to
the author) is available commercially in two products: the Signals
and Systems Pack from Wolfram Research, and a book entitled "Mathematica
Notebooks to Accompany Contemporary Linear Systems Using MATLAB" from

Communication Systems) here at Washington State University.
They use the SPP by Brian Evans.  They discuss many concepts
associated with linear systems theory.  Topics
covered include LTI system theory, convolution, AM, FM, PM
modulation and demodulation, and the sampling theorem.  NOTE:
All Notebooks were developed under NeXTSTEP 3.1 using
Mathematica 2.2.  I make no guarantees about the graphics
being able to be rendered on anything other than a NeXT.

<dt><h4>Shorten</h4><dd>

<dt>Description:<dd>Shorten is a compressor/coder for waveform files.
It supports both lossless coding and lossy coding down to three bits per
sample.  It operates using a linear predictor and Huffman coding the
prediction residual using Rice codes.  A <a
href="http://svr-www.eng.cam.ac.uk/Reports/ajr/TR156/tr156.html">technical
report</a> shows that this simple scheme is both fast and near optimal.
Data formats supported are RIFF WAVE plus signed and unsigned values at
8 or 16 bits per sample, ulaw, alaw and multiple interleaved channels.
For lossless compression of speech files recorded using 16 bits at 16
kHz the compression ratio is typically 2:1.  CD audio (44.1 kHz, 16 bit
stereo) is near transparant at 4:1 or 5:1 lossy compression.

<p>
<dt>Platforms:<dd>The command line version compiles on most UNIX
platforms.   A version is available for MS Windows/NT.

<h3>Q1.3.5: Text to Speech Conversion Software</h3>
<small>Updated 1/7/97</small><p>
<dl>
<dt><dd>
Free (but not public domain) text to speech conversion
software is available via anonymous ftp from
wilma.cs.brown.edu in the pub directory as speak.tar.Z.  It
will compile and run on a SPARC's built-in audio after
modifying speak.c with the path of your libaudio.h (e.g.,
/usr/demo/SOUND/libaudio.h).  It's a simple phoneme
concatenation system with commensurate synthesized speech
quality (a directory of phoneme audio files is included).
<small>[Joe Campbell, jpcampb@afterlife.ncsc.mil]</small>
<p>
A public domain version of the same Naval Research Lab text
to phoneme rules can be obtained from:
<p>
<A href="ftp://svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/comp.speech/synthesis/english2phoneme.tar.gz">ftp://svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/comp.speech/syntheses/english2phoneme.tar.gz</A>

<p>
The comp.speech FTP site includes a speech synthesis directory at
<a href="ftp://svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/comp.speech/synthesis">
ftp://svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/comp.speech/synthesis.</a>
The main package is "rsynth" which is a complete text to speech synthesis
system.  Several component packages are also present.  "textnorm"
converts non-words such as digit strings into words (e.g. 1000 to
ONE THOUSAND).  "english2phoneme" does some of the same but its main
functionality is to guess an appropriate phoneme sequence for each
word.  "klatt" takes a parametric form that describes each phoneme
and converts it to a waveform.  Other packages exist in the same
directory to edit and visualise the klatt parameters.

<h3>Q1.3.6: Filter Design Software</h3>
<small>Updated 03/30/01</small><p>

<ul><li>There are filter design programs available via anonymous FTP.  The
following are summarized here and discussed in greater detail
below:<p>
<ul>
<li>August 1992 IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing: METEOR FIR
filter design program.
<li>DFiltFIR and DFiltInt FIR filter design program.
<li>Netlib IIR filter design.
<li>IEEE Press &quot;Programs for Digital Signal Processing&quot;.
<li>Tod Schuck's near-optimal Kaiser-Bessel program.
<li>Brian Evans' and Niranjan Damera-Venkata's packages for Matlab and Mathematica.
<li>ScopeFIR.
<li>FilterExpress.
<li>Charles Poynton's filter design resource page.
<li>Juhana Kouhia's hotlist.
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
<ul><li>
The August 92 issue of IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
includes a paper entitled &quot;METEOR: A Constraint-Based FIR
Filter Design Program&quot; by Kenneth Steiglitz, Thomas W. Parks
and James F. Kaiser.  The authors describe an FIR design program
which allows specification of the target frequency response
characteristics in a fairly generalized and flexible way.  As
well as designing filters, the program can optimize filter
lengths and push band limits.
<p>
The source for the programs (meteor.p, form.p, meteor.c, and form.c) and
the METEOR paper as a postscript file may be found at <a
href="http://www.music.Princeton.edu/classes/class.html">http://www.
music.Princeton.edu/classes/class.html</a>. The programs were originally
written in Pascal and then evidentally run through p2c to produce the C
versions; all the necessary Pascal library stuff is included in the C
code and they built error-free out of the box for me on an SGI machine.
<p>
There is no manual. The paper includes instructions on running the programs.
<small>[Steve Clift, clift@mail.anacapa.net]</small>
<p>
Weimin Liu has created a Windows 95 interface to the Meteor program, which
can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.nyx.net/~wliu/filter.html">http://www.nyx.net/~wliu/filter.html</A>.
</ul>

<p>
<ul><li>
Other free filter design packages are DFiltFIR and DFiltInt.  DFiltFIR designs minimax approximation FIR filters. It uses the algorithm developed by McClelland and Parks and incorporates constraints on the response as proposed by Grenez. DFiltInt designs minimum mean-square error FIR interpolating filters. The design specification is in terms of a tabulated power spectrum model for the input signal.

<p>
The packages are available from
<a href=http://www.tsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Docs/Software/FilterDesign/FilterDesign.html>
http://www.tsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Docs/Software/FilterDesign/FilterDesign.html</a>
or directly via anonymous ftp from
<a hrefftp://ftp.tsp.ece.mcgill.ca/TSP/FilterDesign/>
ftp://ftp.tsp.ece.mcgill.ca/TSP/FilterDesign/</a>.

<p>
Another package, libtsp, is a library of C-language routines for signal processing.
The package is available from
<A href=http://www.tsp.ece.mcgill.ca/reports/Software/libtsp/libtsp.html>

The Fortran source code from the IEEE Press book &quot;Programs
For Digital Signal Processing&quot; is available by anonymous ftp
from 
<A HREF="ftp://soma.crl.mcmaster.ca/pub/IEEE/software/dsp.zip">ftp://soma.crl.mcmaster.ca/pub/IEEE/software/dsp.zip</A>
or

It includes FIR and IIR filter design software, FFT
subroutines, interpolation programs, a coherence and
cross-spectral estimation program, linear prediction analysis
programs, and a frequency domain filtering program.

There is also a C/C++ version of the McClellan-Parks-Rabiner FIR
filter design program available from
<A href=ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume22/fir/part01.Z>ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume22/fir/part01.Z</A>

<p>
This program was created and tested using Borland C++ 2.0.
This requires a pretty reasonable C++ compiler - it is
reported that QuickC (not C++) won't do it.

<p>
<ul><li>
I have developed a MATLAB (vers 4.0 for Windows) program that allows 
for the frequency domain design of the "near optimal" Kaiser-Bessel 
window. The program is based upon the three closed form equations 
developed by Kaiser and Schafer in 1981 that allow for the 
specification of the time domain window length, and the frequency 
domain mainlobe width and relative sidelobe amplitude. For signal 
processing applications where the spectral content of the windowing 
function is critical so as not to mask adjacent spectra such as radar 
signal processing applications where a weak target return adjacent to 
a strong target return could be easily masked by a windowing function 
that resolves poorly in frequency; this program allows complete 
frequency domain specification of the spectral characteristics of the 
windowing function. The current version of this program allows for the 
user to specify the two frequency domain parameters of mainlobe width 
and relative sidelobe amplitude and lets the window length fall out as 
the dependent variable. The program is easily modified to allow for 
any two parameters to be selected and allowing the third to be 
determined as a result.<P>
     
This program will output to an ASCII file the window coefficients that 
can be easily dumped to an EPROM or included in a program. It also 
generates both time and frequency domain graphs so that the user can 
visually verify the widow record length and spectral content. I will 
gladly provide any interested parties with my MATLAB code.

<ul><li>Filter Optimization Packages for Matlab and Mathematica,
version 1.1 by Brian L. Evans and Niranjan Damera-Venkata, Dept. of ECE,
The University of Texas at Austin. Available from <A

</A>.

<P>We have released a set of Matlab packages to optimize the following
characteristics of analog filter designs simultaneously:

<P><OL><LI>magnitude response 
<LI>linear phase in the passband
<LI>peak overshoot in the step response
<LI>quality factors (Q)
</OL>

<P>subject to constraints on the same characteristics.  The Matlab
packages take about 10 seconds for fourth-order filters and 3 minutes
for eighth-order filters to run on a 167-MHz Sun Ultra-2 workstation.

<P>We use the symbolic mathematics environment Mathematica to describe
the constrained non-linear optimization problem formally, derive the
gradients of the cost function and constraints, and synthesize the
Matlab code to perform the optimization.  In the public release,
we provide the Matlab to optimize analog IIR filters of fourth,
sixth, and eighth orders.  Using the Mathematica formulation, designers
can add new measures and constraints, such as capacitance spread for
integrated circuit layout, and regenerate the Matlab code.

<P>We describe the framework in [1].  An earlier version of the framework
is described in [2].  We plan to extend this framework to digital IIR
filters.
