Inherently interdisciplinary, work in the field draws heavily on solid results from the theory of computation, cognitive and behavioral psychology, and neuroscience. Topics range from "bottom-up" modeling of brain operation and its emergent function to high-level operations such as problem- solving and reasoning, learning, and language understanding. The ICS artificial intelligence group maintains a balance between these two concerns, recognizing that each contributes to the other through the following three distinguished areas: 1. On findings from psychology and neurobiology that suggest computational algorithms, and analyses of such algorithms that suggest explanations for capabilities and limitations of human cognition. 2. On machine learning---the mechanisms by which knowledge is acquired through experience. 3. On Knowledge representation and reasoning -- the methods by which the acquired knowledge is summarized, organized, and utilized to help solve real-life problems.

Individual research or investigation under the direction of an individual faculty member. Research Interests: The overall aim of my research is to devise methods of automated reasoning via the understanding and exploitation of tractable classes of reasoning tasks. I believe that approximation methods based on tractable models cover a significant portion of intelligent activities and, hence, should serve as the cornerstone in automated reasoning systems. This principle has motivated my previous research on greedy problems, mechanical generation of heuristics, topological decompositions, and local computations in constraint networks [TI-1,TI-2,TI-3,EE-1]. Constraint networks have proven to be a useful language for modeling and solving computationally intensive tasks in Artificial Intelligence. The language of constraints expresses information in terms of the desired relationships among entities without specifying how such relationships are to be achieved. Constraint networks are used to model mundane cognitive tasks (e.g., vision, language comprehension, default reasoning, abduction) as well as applications such as scheduling, design, and diagnosis which require high levels of human expertise. In general, the tasks posed in this language are computationally intractable (NP-hard). A survey of constraint networks appears in the following reference. Dechter, R. "Constraint Networks," in the Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence, second ed., Wiley and Sons, pp. 276-285, 1992 In recent years, I have developed and analyzed a large number of techniques for finding partial and complete solutions to a variety of constraint classes, often accompanied by theoretical guarantees of worst-case performance. These techniques, including directional consistency, adaptive consistency, trei clustering, cycle cutset schemes, backjumping, and search-based learning, have become popular in many constraint-processing applications [EE-1,TI-4,TI-5,TI-6]. My current research interests focus on developing scalable techniques in constraint processing and on applying those techniques to broader areas in automated reasoning. The following is an outline of my research projects. Empirical evaluation of constraint processing algorithms: One of my continuing research goals is to close the gap between theory and practice in constraint processing. To that end, I plan to perform a large-scale experimentation on both real-life and simulated systems. I am currently building an environment in which large scale constraint-based problems could be modeled, processed, evaluated, and analyzed. The project promises to yield a deeper understanding of those features in the domain that admit efficient processing. I hope that this understanding will lead to scalable algorithms, and to new software tools and languages for generic constraint-processing applications. My experimental work focuses both on comparing backtracking style algorithms as well as local search greedy algorithms. Constraint processing is described in [EE-1,EE-2,EE-3,EE-4,EE-5,EE-6,EE-7]. Temporal Reasoning: In the past few years, I (with I. Meiri and J. Pearl) have developed a general network-based framework for temporal reasoning capable of handling both qualitative and quantitative temporal information [TR-1,TR-2]. Using this framework I characterized new tractable problems involving qualitative networks augmented by quantitative domains. I plan to explore the applicability of this framework to two practical domains: scheduling and stories understanding. Currently, I am developing a language that will be able to express information about fluents events and constraints whose computational tool is based on temporal constraint networks [TR-4]. Initial empirical evaluation of new approximation algorithms are reported in [TR-3,TR-5]. Qualitative reasoning and diagnosis: A physical system can be formulated by a set of constraints and subsequently be processed by constraint processing algorithms. Such algorithms were developed for finding a best diagnosis, finding all minimal cardinality, or all minimal diagnoses [QR-1,QR-3]. These algorithms exploit the structure of the system and they are particularly useful for systems that have sparse graphs. I intend to empirically compare the performance of such structure-based diagnosis algorithms with more traditional approaches. Initial results are described in [QR-2]. Constraint-based nonmonotonic reasoning: I (with R. Ben-Eliyahu) have recently formed a connection between constraint-based algorithms and nonmonotonic reasoning [NM-1,NM-2,NM-3], thus uncovering new tractable classes of logic programs and default knowledge bases. I plan to extend these results to nonpropositional languages and to demonstrate the potential of such techniques in practical logic programming applications. Distributed and connectionist-like constraint processing: I am studying the computational features and convergence of constraint networks under local distributed computation. Initial investigations have generated new insights and general principles governing network representations [DC-1,DC-2]. Through these investigations, I hope to devise distributed and parallel architectures for processing constraint-based information. Potentially, this could lead to a substantial speed up in processing time while also simplifying programming. Causal and directional constraint networks: My aim is to establish a formal basis for causal theories using the language of relational algebra and (directed) constraint networks. Specifically, I wish to identify the features responsible for the computational effectiveness of causal predictions (e.g., forward analysis of combinatorial circuits), thus explaining some of the reasons that causal models are so popular in the organization of human knowledge. Initial investigation has given rise to a new representation scheme, called directional constraint networks, which promises to uncover new "islands of tractability" by imposing causal orders on unstructured specifications of constraints [CA-1]. Tractable islands and the role of topology in reasoning: Throughout my research I have investigated the role of the knowledge structure in enabling fast reasoning which had led to the identification of several structure-based tractable islands [TI-1,TI-2,TI-3]. I will continue to investigate this issue by exploring the role of the dependency graph of various propositional theories. I have recently shown that the Davis-Putnam original algorithm lends itself to nice complexity bounds that are based on the theory topology. My empirical tests confirm theoretical predictions by parameters like "induced width" and "diversity," showing that on problems with special structures, like chains, directional resolution (my variant of Davis-Putnam) greatly out-performs the popular Davis-Putnam procedure [TI-4]. Recently I have discovered new tractable classes that are based on the syntactic nature of the constraints. These are the row-convex constraint and tight domains and constraints [TI-5,TI-6,TI-7]. Structure identifiability and knowledge compilation: In the past few years I have presented algorithms for uncovering tree-structured knowledge-bases from raw data [ST-1,ST-2]. I have presented a new framework for studying the identifiability of such tractable structures and the identifiability of classes of constraint networks: Horn theories were also characterized [ST-3,ST-4,ST-6]. I am currently empirically investigating the value of such compilation methods both for identifiability and for learning [ST-5].

In recent years, I have developed and analyzed a large number of

My current research interests focus on developing scalable techniques
in constraint processing and on applying those techniques to broader
areas in automated reasoning.  The following is an outline of my
research projects.
<P>

One of my continuing research goals is to close the gap between theory
and practice in constraint processing. To that end, I plan to perform
a large-scale experimentation on both real-life and simulated systems.
I am currently building an environment in which large scale constraint-based

<H2> Temporal Reasoning: </H2>
<P>
In the past few years, I (with I. Meiri and J. Pearl) have developed a
general network-based framework for temporal reasoning capable of
handling both qualitative and quantitative temporal information [TR-1,TR-2].
Using this framework I characterized new tractable problems involving
qualitative networks augmented by quantitative domains.  I plan to
explore the applicability of this framework to two practical domains:
scheduling and stories understanding.  Currently, I am developing a
language that will be able to express information about fluents events
and constraints whose computational tool is based on temporal constraint
networks [TR-4].  Initial empirical evaluation of new approximation algorithms
are reported in [TR-3,TR-5].
<p>
<H2> Qualitative reasoning and diagnosis: </H2>

A physical system can be formulated by a set of constraints and
subsequently be processed by constraint processing algorithms.  Such

exploit the structure of the system and they are particularly useful
for systems that have sparse graphs.  I intend to empirically compare
the performance of such structure-based diagnosis algorithms with more
traditional approaches.  Initial results are described in [QR-2].

I (with R. Ben-Eliyahu) have recently formed a connection between
constraint-based algorithms and nonmonotonic reasoning [NM-1,NM-2,NM-3], thus
uncovering new tractable classes of logic programs and default knowledge
bases.  I plan to extend these results to nonpropositional languages and
to demonstrate the potential of such techniques in practical logic
programming applications.
<P>

I am studying the computational features and convergence of constraint
networks under local distributed computation.  Initial investigations
have generated new insights and general principles governing network
representations [DC-1,DC-2].  Through these investigations, I hope to devise
distributed and parallel architectures for processing constraint-based
information. Potentially, this  could lead to a substantial speed up
in processing time while also simplifying programming.

Specifically, I wish to identify the features responsible for the
computational effectiveness of causal predictions (e.g., forward

new "islands of tractability" by imposing causal orders on unstructured

structure in enabling fast reasoning which had led to the identification
of several structure-based tractable islands [TI-1,TI-2,TI-3].  I will continue
to investigate this issue by exploring the role of the dependency graph
of various propositional theories.  I have recently shown that the Davis-Putnam
