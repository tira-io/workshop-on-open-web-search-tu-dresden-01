<h1>Brian Foley</h1>
<p>The page that was here was not very good, so I have taken it down until I get time to design a page that I am happy with.  In the meantime you could look at <a href="http://www.tcd.ie/Clubs/DUHAC/" title="Dublin University Harriers and Athletic Club">DUHAC</a>'s webpage, which I maintain at the moment and which is vastly superior to this.</p>
<p>My <a href="./CV/" title="Curriculum Vitae">CV</a> is only slightly out of date.</p>

<h1>Eldorado</h1>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaily bedight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gallant knight,<br>
In sunshine and in shadow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had journeyed long,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing a song,<br>
In search of Eldorado.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he grew old-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knight so bold-<br>
And o'er his heart a shadow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell as he found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No spot of ground<br>
That looked like Eldorado.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as his strength<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failed him at length,<br>
He met a pilgrim shadow-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shadow," said he,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where can it be-<br>
This land of Eldorado?"
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Over the Mountains<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Moon,<br>
Down the Valley of the Shadow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ride, boldly ride,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shade replied-<br>
"If you seek for Eldorado!"
</p>

<p>--Edgar Allan Poe</p>
