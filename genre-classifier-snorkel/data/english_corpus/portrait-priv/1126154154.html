 Daniel K. Gebhart - private homepage - stuff that doesn't matter! stuff that doesn't matter! blog    |    about    |    gallery    |    projects    |    fun    |    contact a bit about me.. how to reach me? best way is probably by mail or IRC (IRCNet, freenode) Nick: con-fuse. If you wanna have my phone number, please contact me first in one of the ways described above. ;) where do I get my money from? At the moment I work as UNIX Systemadministrator at the University of Innsbruck in a group named Distributed and Parallel Systems . computers I'm working with computers since ~ 1993. The first Linux I've installed was Ver. 2.0.34. This was when I fell in love with Linux and the open source community. :) First I just used all the free software and enjoyed using it. A few months later I decided to give something back to the community and started to publish all the things I done under the GPL (as far as possible). At this time I'm an activist in a local LUG (Linux User Group Tirol - www.lugt.at). Therefor I give talks about OSS, help newbies in learning Linux, organize events (IFIT - this weekend for example),.. Also I write for german IT based magazines (heise, freex, etc.). What do I do for Debian (my favorite project and distribution) at the moment? I'm one of the founders of debian-mentors (mentors.debian.net). This project is at the moment in test phase and it should be launched until the next months. This project will help new maintainers in publishing their packages at our online repoitory. Then the NMs just have to tell their sponsor where they can find their packages and sponsors can download it centeralized from this repository. Every week I help in controlling and fixing the german translation of DWN and will help translating it in future. At different events I give talks about debian or just organize and support debian booths. I'm the maintainer of dhelp. We are on the way to rewrite dhelp at the moment. The new dhelp will be written in python and uses namazu as its searchengine. It will support searching for docs without having a webserver installed. My Co-Maintainer (Daniel Nouri) writes a lot of this stuff. I'm on the way to convince educational institutes to use Debian GNU/Linux and a pilot project is in development. If this is still not enought about me and my doings I would like to point you to http://mentors.debian.net/~dkg/ where you'll find my CV and a skill-sheet. --> &#169; 2003 All rights shared.
