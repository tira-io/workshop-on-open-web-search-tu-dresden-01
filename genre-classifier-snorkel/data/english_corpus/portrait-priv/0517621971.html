<h1>What MIT Should Do</h1>
<p>
<p> I believe technology is about to take university education through a perioda 
of instability&#151;what Andy Grove would call a 10X period&#151;as new 
educational technology is introduced for the first time since the invention 
of movable type.  This period of instability coincides with a window of 
global scientific opportunity and global engineering challenge.
<p>
<p> Accordingly, I believe that technical universities that want to be 
important in 2050 should chart a new course now, which I lay out, somewhat 
telegraphically in a <A HREF="mit.html"> sample mission statement 
</a> and in a <a href="interview.html"> fanciful interview</a>, recorded in 
2050.
<h1>Professional Activities</h1>
