 Byzantine and Medieval Web Links Back to Internet History Sourcebooks Project Last Update : September 9, 1998 BYZANTINE &amp; MEDIEVAL LINKS INDEX Notice: until this list is updated, please use www.netserf.org [March 2001: this list is now quite out dated. Many links are dead, and there are hundreds of of additional resources around. Manual maintence of this list long ago became unfeasible. I do intend to update it, once I have located good links management software.] This page attempts to track ALL Byzantine material on the Internet, and ALL significant entry points for Medieval studies. Ancient and Classical links, except insofar as they impinge directly on Byzantine and Western Medieval matters, should be sought out via the direct links provided to ARGOS associates which track and maintain sites devoted to the Ancient world. Since this page was begun, the Medieval and Byzantine Internet has exploded in size. As a result, although I will take suggestions, I will no longer add the following materials: Syllabi for courses, unless the page contains additional material - texts, graphics, lecture notes. History Department sites, unless the page contains additional material - texts, graphics (etc.) Sites at geocities, or any other free web site which forcibly opens pop up windows. AOL sites, which seem to last just a few weeks on average. Sites which do not look to be stable: e.g. temporary exhbition pages. Sites for individual Orthodox or Easter Catholic churches, unless the page contains additional material (see above). Gopher sites. Gopher is dead. If you thought you once saw a website here, but its not here now, check the Dead Links Page ! hits since May 31 1998 LE FastCounter The structure of this set of World Wide Web Links is as follows. You can browse through the entire list, or jump directly to the part that interests you by selecting the underlined links.

The Web is so vast now that it contains more, and more diverse information, than any single printed source. This availability of information will only increase. To use the Web efficiently, the various search engines are essential. Yahoo is best, I think, if you are looking for specialized websites. Lycos, Excite, and Hotbot all index many more documents. These engines will always turn up more references, but far more will be dross than with Yahoo. It is useful to start with Yahoo since it has a nice feature - once it tells you everything that it has found, it will automatically plug you in to the other search engines. It is important to form your query words as clearly as possible. For instance, if you are interested in finding information on a particular musician, do not search for &quot;music&quot;, but for a style [eg &quot;jazz&quot; or &quot;gregorian chant&quot;] or even a name [&quot;abba&quot;, &quot;charlie parker&quot;, &quot;hildegard&quot;]. As the WWW has grown these wide area engines have become more difficult to use. Searching for &quot;Plato&quot; for instance, will return more &quot;hits&quot; than one could possibly read in a lifetime. For this reason it is best to start searches for Byzantine and Medieval subjects with the &quot;limited area&quot; ARGOS search engine. Google Yahoo Hotbot Excite Lycos Dedicated Byzantine Sites Byzantine Studies - Top Sites GENERAL BYZANTINE MAJOR SITES Byzantium: Byzantine Studies on the Internet Created by the maintainer of this links page, this is currently the most extensive Byzantine site on the net.

Byzantium1200 A wonderful site which provided CAD drawings of 50 buildings in Constantinople as they would have been in 1200. The Constantinople Project Over the past several years, Professor Ahmet Cakmak, of Princeton University's Department of Civil Engineering and Operations Research has undertaken the structural analysis, under earthquake loads, of the Hagia Sophia, the major church built by the Emperor Justinian during the 6th century AD. Professor Cakmak sought to determine the susceptibility of the structure, specifically its large dome and arches, to collapse due to the earthquakes that often strike that part of the world. As an extension of that work into the architectural realm, he recently offered a class which studied Byzantine structures from a structural and art-historical perspective. One of the goals set forth in the class was for students to construct three-dimensional models of specific Byzantine structures utilizing the computer drafting software AutoCAD. This was the first step towards a long term goal of creating a full model of the topography of ancient Constantinople, with models of many Byzantine buildings in place. &quot;ISTANBUL&quot; Istanbul Guide History of Istanbul A Turkish perspective Searching Byzantium Photographs of Modern Istanbul.

It is both a research tool and a mode of publishing information on papers in a centrally accessible way, and much more. The database interface is not yet functional, but the rest is, and there's a lot to think about there relevant to the methodological issues about use of evidence from paper to identify scribes and centers of book production. Part of it (the bibliographical database) is mostly just a shell at the moment, but you can see how it will work once our database interface is done.

MONTES Orthodox Prayers Jump Back to INDEX Orthodox Monasteries,Churches, Cathedrals St. Catherine's Monastery, Mt. Sinai St. Catherine's Monastery located in Sinai at the foot of Mount Moses (Mt. Sinai) is a true jewel of Christian heritage. Founded around 527, it is the oldest fully functioning monastery in the world. Yet, because of its isolation, fortification and specific protection granted by the Prophet Mohammed, it remains original and pristine. Its powerful setting seems a natural home for the many rare Christian icons which it houses, including a collection of original illuminated manuscripts second only to the Vatican. Within, one will find the chapel of the Burning Bush, which is believed to be built atop the famous burning bush of Moses, but most Christians have never even seen the monastery s exterior, and interior views are almost non-existent. Egypt s Ministry of Tourism has expanded these pages so that we can now have a first look into this fascinating Christian setting. It is worth a visit.

Using the WWWin Teaching History paper given at 1996 AHA convention Medieval Maps Index A large series of maps of Europe, all keyed into to specific dates. Map History / History of Cartography Historical and Cultural Atlas Resource Maps in a new on-line atlas use the latest technology -- animation and pull-down menus -- to help show how nations have been settled and how empires have risen and collapsed. The atlas offers more than 50 maps -- about half of them interactive -- and is divided into two sections. A group of maps of North America focuses on important themes in 18th- and 19th-century U.S. history, such as territorial expansion and slavery. A section on Europe explores trade routes, political change, urbanization, and the distribution of natural resources. Also on the site are maps of North Africa and the Middle East. Users can follow the expansion of Macedonia under Philip II and his son, Alexander the Great, in the fourth century B.C.; compare migration routes of the Vandals, Franks, Huns, Saxons, and Visigoths during the time of the Roman Empire's disintegration; and examine changes in slave-population density in 19th-century America. To see the interactive maps, users must have free Shockwave software installed on their computers and must have computers that can handle graphics.

size="4"> </font></h3>

<p>Here are links to the best &quot;wide area&quot; search engines on the Web. The Web is
so vast now that it contains more, and more diverse information, than any single printed
source. This availability of information will only increase. </p>

<p>To use the Web efficiently, the various search engines are essential. <b>Yahoo</b> is
best, I think, if you are looking for specialized websites. <b>Lycos, Excite, and Hotbot </b>all
index many more documents. These engines will always turn up more references, but far more
will be dross than with Yahoo. It is useful to start with <b>Yahoo</b> since it has a nice
feature - once it tells you everything that it has found, it will automatically plug you
in to the other search engines. </p>

<p>It is important to form your query words as clearly as possible. For instance, if you
are interested in finding information on a particular musician, do not search for
&quot;music&quot;, but for a style [eg &quot;jazz&quot; or &quot;gregorian chant&quot;] or
even a name [&quot;abba&quot;, &quot;charlie parker&quot;, &quot;hildegard&quot;]. </p>

<p>As the WWW has grown these wide area engines have become more difficult to use.
Searching for &quot;Plato&quot; for instance, will return more &quot;hits&quot; than one
could possibly read in a lifetime. For this reason it is best to start searches for
Byzantine and Medieval subjects with the &quot;limited area&quot; ARGOS search engine.<br>

        Over the past several years, Professor Ahmet Cakmak, of Princeton University's Department
        of Civil Engineering and Operations Research has undertaken the structural analysis, under
        earthquake loads, of the Hagia Sophia, the major church built by the Emperor Justinian
        during the 6th century AD. Professor Cakmak sought to determine the susceptibility of the
        structure, specifically its large dome and arches, to collapse due to the earthquakes that
        often strike that part of the world. As an extension of that work into the architectural
        realm, he recently offered a class which studied Byzantine structures from a structural
        and art-historical perspective. One of the goals set forth in the class was for students
        to construct three-dimensional models of specific Byzantine structures utilizing the
        computer drafting software AutoCAD. This was the first step towards a long term goal of
        creating a full model of the topography of ancient Constantinople, with models of many
        Byzantine buildings in place. </li>

  <li><a href="http://interoz.com/egypt/Catherines.htm" _lase="argos:2">St. Catherine's
    Monastery, Mt. Sinai</a> St. Catherine's Monastery located in Sinai at the foot of Mount
    Moses (Mt. Sinai) is a true jewel of Christian heritage. Founded around 527, it is the
    oldest fully functioning monastery in the world. Yet, because of its isolation,
    fortification and specific protection granted by the Prophet Mohammed, it remains original
    and pristine. Its powerful setting seems a natural home for the many rare Christian icons
    which it houses, including a collection of original illuminated manuscripts second only to
    the Vatican. Within, one will find the chapel of the Burning Bush, which is believed to be
    built atop the famous burning bush of Moses, but most Christians have never even seen the
    monastery s exterior, and interior views are almost non-existent. Egypt s Ministry of
    Tourism has expanded these pages so that we can now have a first look into this
    fascinating Christian setting. It is worth a visit. Go to antiquities and then monuments,
    or to destinations and then Sinai to find the St. Catherine pages. </li>

    Maps in a new on-line atlas use the latest technology -- animation and pull-down menus --
    to help show how nations have been settled and how empires have risen and collapsed. The
    atlas offers more than 50 maps -- about half of them interactive -- and is divided into
    two sections. A group of maps of North America focuses on important themes in 18th- and
    19th-century U.S. history, such as territorial expansion and slavery. A section on Europe
    explores trade routes, political change, urbanization, and the distribution of natural
    resources. Also on the site are maps of North Africa and the Middle East. Users can follow
    the expansion of Macedonia under Philip II and his son, Alexander the Great, in the fourth
    century B.C.; compare migration routes of the Vandals, Franks, Huns, Saxons, and Visigoths
    during the time of the Roman Empire's disintegration; and examine changes in
    slave-population density in 19th-century America. To see the interactive maps, users must
    have free Shockwave software installed on their computers and must have computers that can
    handle graphics. </li>
