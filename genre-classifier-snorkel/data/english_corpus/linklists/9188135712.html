 Astronomy Picture of the Day's Educational Links Astronomy Picture of the Day's Educational Links What follows is a list of resources that excel in astronomy education. Each resource is distinctly different - they have been chosen to highlight a wide range of interests. We believe the list is topologically complete in that there are no publicly advertised astronomy resources on the WWW that cannot be found by following the internal links of these resources. The list is in alphabetical order, and is subject to change as the WWW, and our knowledge of it, matures. APOD in the Classroom How Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) is being used as a learning tool by teachers and students. Ask the Space Scientist Answers to thousands of astronomy questions by Dr. Sten Odenwald. Astronomy HyperText Book Several astronomy lectures on an intermediate level. You can also ask a question, through e-mail, of an astronomy expert. Astronomy with a Stick Elementary school astronomy activities that can be done with only a stick. Brought to you by the National Science Teachers Association . Astronomy Picture of the Day Subject Sorted Archive This archive contains Astronomy Pictures of the Day (TM) sorted by subject and is updated monthly. AstroWeb: Astronomical Internet Resources An exhaustive list of astronomy resources on the internet. ASCL: The Astrophysics Source Code Library An archive of computer programs useful to researchers in astronomy or astrophysics. Black holes and Neutron Stars Take a virtual trip to a black hole or neutron star. Have your MPEG movie player ready. Intended for the advanced student, but fun for everyone. The Exploratorium A fun way to explore science for a beginner. George Mason University's Introductory Astronomy Lecture Notes Lecture outlines and transparencies for an introductory college level astronomy class. Knowledge of pre-calculus level mathematics is assumed. Great Debates in Astronomy Do leading astronomers always agree? Not always. Here are detailed accounts of several debates in astronomy starting with the famous Scale of the Universe discussion in 1920 between Curtis and Shapley. Imagine the Universe! This premier internet education site now covers a broad range of astronomy topics. "Imagine the Universe!" is a service of the Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics at NASA/ Goddard Space Flight Center. Hubble Space Telescope Public Information Detailed pictures and explanations of Hubble Space Telescope results. NASA Spacelink - An Electronic Information System for Educators An entry into NASA's educational projects. Intended for teachers looking for on-line teaching aids. The Night Sky Live See the night sky live from some of the world's premier observing sites. This growing global network of CONtinuous CAMeras (CONCAMs) returns live images of stars, planets, meteors, and much more. StarChild: A Learning Center for Young Astronomers Intended primarily for ages 4-14, this site presents material on the Solar System, the Universe, and other Space Stuff. Produced by a collaboration of professional scientists and educators it is one of the very few astronomy WWW sites for elementary school readers.

education. Each resource is distinctly different - they have been chosen to
highlight a wide range of interests. We believe the list is topologically
complete in that there are no publicly advertised 
astronomy resources on the WWW that cannot be
found by following the internal links of these resources.  The list is in
