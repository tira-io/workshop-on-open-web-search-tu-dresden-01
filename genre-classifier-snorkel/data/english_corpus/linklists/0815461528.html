contains several of his works) Cinemapt.com - Portugal no Cinema (a commercial site devoted to film-making, both commercial and amateur, with a focus on Portugal; contains a listing of upcoming film festivals, provider directory, classified ads, and related new; nice page but heavy on multimedia so if you're using a modem, beware...) Clube Portugu&ecirc;s de Canicultura (a complete page on dogs, dog-breeding, and competing; has information on upcoming contests, listed breeders, and local groups; the most interesting part for me was the list of dogs that are specifically/typically Portuguese--with pictures; in Portuguese and English) Origin and History of the Portuguese Water Dog (perhaps more than you ever wanted to know about this typically-Portuguese animal; this page is all text and contains a list and descriptions of the ancient origins of the dog, as well as a section on what roles the dog played in Portuguese history; part of a much larger compendium on all dogs) Wines from the Bairrada Region ([turn-on-bias-toward-wine] an excellent page dedicated to the wines of Bairrada, actually, this is a commercial site so you'd expect it, but also includes a picture of Portugal with all of its viticultural areas and an on-line glossary of wine terms; very nice graphics [turn-off-bias-toward-wine]) CEHA's Collection of Wine Links (this is the most complete collection of links I've seen on wine, certainly from the point of view that it is all-encompassing; includes links to wineries, suppliers, ratings, histories, and Internet newsgroups; obviously, it includes a lot of links to Portuguese sites that one does not typically find elsewhere) Reference Pages on Portuguese 'Things'... Portugal Telecom (the Portuguese telephone company's look-up pages: you can look up useful numbers as well as person's home numbers; the "useful numbers" pages allows you to drill down, by area, into city halls, military headquarters, local transportation, etc.) Lus&iacute;adas -- Guia de Buscas Lus&oacute;fonas (a directory of Portuguese sites and a search engine; categories of Web pages include culture, politics, children, music, turism, and so on; you can also add your own page; the text search engine is Sapo) Cusco (allows search of text from 'any' Portuguese Web page; unfortunately, limits the search to 8 hits; allows you to enter your own URL) GUIANet--O Universo Empresarial Portugu&ecirc;s (a directory of Portuguese companies and businesses--lists addresses and telephone numbers; can look-up by company name, business, or sector; the page also has a section that lists the latest currency rate for the Escudo by the Banco de Portugal; also available in English ) MWEB -- Marcas na Web (online look-up of Portuguese brands and products--you can 'drill down' from a generic product name down to specific products and then the companies that provide them, with addresses and telephone numbers) Priberam Informatica's On-Line Dictionary (though it's a commercial site, it offers on-line lookups for words, verb conjugations, and a download of a limited version of their dictionary product; has a pretty good collection of links to other language and dictionary sites) Dicion&aacute;rio Oficial e T&eacute;cnico da Comunidade Europeia: Interface em PORTUGU&Ecirc;S (the official Portuguese front-end to EURODICAUTOM, the official European technical dictionary; you enter a technical word in a European language and ask for its translation in another European language; pretty handy sometimes to have access to this... I only wonder why it hasn't been publicized widely...) Mailing lists and Newsgroups... You can typically send an email to subscribe@ at the email address shown. The collection of mailing lists includes only a couple thus far but I know that there are others... Internet Newsgroup soc.culture.portuguese (if your Web browser supports it and your ISP has access, you can view the latest exchanges on this worldwide newsgroup and associated mailing list) Autarnet's List of Emails (this page has quite a collection of mailing lists you can join although they deal mostly with local Portuguese governments; there are many city halls and government commissions) Here's the index for this page: Pages about Portugal News and events about Portugal Universities and other Institutions Portuguese Literature and Language Computing Portuguese Cities and Other Geographic Areas Portuguese Archaeology / History / Culture Reference Pages on Portuguese 'Things' Mailing lists and Newsgroups Information about this page And the index for all the pages on Portugal: Main Page | Portuguese Politics | Soccer / Sports | Radio and Television Portuguese Music | Portuguese Gastronomy | Portuguese Genealogy | Portuguese Personal Pages Commercial Ventures | Countries related to Portugal | Other collections of Portuguese links | This page is linked from... Hey! Have any suggestions for additions? Send email to ideamen@well.com . Also, remember that I have a real job and, on occasion, they actually give me work to do--in short, I am happy to add your links but it may take me a couple of days. Finally, I have not included links to pages I don't think are worth it--I review all these sites before I put them here and ONLY include them if they have something to add to the Portuguese world. P.S.: aproveito para dizer que falo Portugu&etilde;s e que podem enviar-me mensagens nesta minha primeira lingua... Maintained by... Robert J.

       larger compendium on all dogs) <p>

       of view that it is all-encompassing; includes links to wineries, suppliers, ratings, histories,
       and Internet newsgroups; obviously, it includes a lot of links to Portuguese sites that one
       does not typically find elsewhere) <p>

  ideamen@well.com</a>.  Also, remember that I have a real job and, on occasion, they actually give me work to do--in
  short, I am happy to add your links but it may take me a couple of days.  Finally, I have not
  included links to pages I don't think are worth it--I review all these sites before I put
  them here and ONLY include them if they have something to add to the Portuguese world.  P.S.: 
  aproveito para dizer que falo Portugu&etilde;s e que podem enviar-me mensagens nesta minha
