And you may not use the search results provided by the

service that competes with products or services offered 
by Google.

If you are interested in doing anything different than 
the foregoing, you must first obtain Google's written 
consent. If you fail to do so, Google reserves the right 
to take legal action.

Furthermore, you may not use Google Web APIs in any 
manner that either directly or indirectly violates any

If you have questions on your contemplated use or if you 
have comments on Google Web APIs or ideas on how to 
improve it, please email api-support@google.com. Please 
note that by doing so, you also grant Google permission 
to use and incorporate your ideas or comments into Google 
Web APIs without further compensation.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
You agree not to remove, obscure, or alter Google's 
copyright notice, trademarks, or other proprietary rights 
notices affixed to or contained within Google Web APIs. 
You also acknowledge that Google owns all right, title 
and interest in and to Google Web APIs, including without 
limitation all intellectual property rights (the "Google 
Rights"). The Google Rights include rights to the

charge. Accordingly, you agree that Google shall have
no liability arising from or based on your use of Google

incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, and
punitive damages whether such claim is based on warranty, 
contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, 
even if Google has been advised of the possibility of 
such damages). Such limitation of liability shall apply 
whether the damages arise from use or misuse of and
reliance on the Google Web APIs, from inability to use 
Google Web APIs, or from the interruption, suspension, 
or termination of Google Web APIs (including such damages 
incurred by third parties). Such limitation shall apply 
notwithstanding a failure of essential purpose of any 
limited remedy and to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Some states or other jurisdictions do not allow the 
exclusion or limitation of liability for incidental or 
consequential damages, so the above limitations and 
exclusions may not apply to you.
