Northwestern University students were invited on Monday to "honor"   <b>Martin Luther King Jr.</b> with a special lunch, which included   collard greens, cornbread and fried chicken. "I was shocked that NU thought it was honoring such an influential and iconic individual by offering stereotypical 'black' foods at their dining halls across campus," writes a student in the second letter-to-the-editor.

Conservative high school student <b>Tim Bueler</b>, whose claims of political harassment by "liberal" students and faculty have made him into something of a youth hero among conservative  bloggers and radio talk show hosts, loves listening to "Savage Nation." He tells a reporter: "I'm missing it right now. <b>I'm getting depressed.</b> It's almost like a drug to me. I have to listen to him."
