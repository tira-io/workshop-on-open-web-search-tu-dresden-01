 IFA Services: Statistics, Sign Test Return to Statistics The Sign Test Example: n+ 12, n- 3, p n+ n- Characteristics: Crudest and most insensitive test. It is also the most convincing and easiest to apply. The level of significance can almost be estimated without the help of a calculator or table. If the Sign-test indicates a significant difference, and another test does not, you should seriously rethink whether the other test is valid. H0: The median value of the distribution is m (generally m = 0), values larger (+) and smaller (-) than the median are equally likely. When matched pairs are used, the probability of observing (A, B) is equal to that of observing (B, A) and the value of A-B has median value 0. Assumptions: None other than H0. Scale: Ordinal, but sometimes nominal when it is used as a binomial test Procedure: Label observations as +/-, positive/negative, greater/smaller, left/right, black/white, male/female, or whatever dichotomy you want to use and count the number of times each label is observed. n+ is the number of times a "+" is observed and n- the number of times a "-" is observed. Ignore all zero or equal observations. Level of Significance: n+ and n- are binomial distributed with p = q = 1/2 and N = (n+) + (n-). If k is the smaller of (n+) and (n-) then: p N !/(i!*( N -i)!)}/4 (with k! = k*(k-1)*(k-2)*...*1 is the factorial of k and 0! = 1) Approximation: If (n+) + (n-) = N > 25, then Z = (| n+ - n- | - 1)/sqrt( N ) can be approximated with a Standard Normal distribution . In our example, we calculate the exact probabilities upto N = 100. For N > 30, the Student t-test can be used. However, the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks test is a better alternative. Remarks: The Sign-test answers the question: How often? , whereas other tests answer the question How much? . It must be kept in mind that these two questions might have different answers. When the problem concerns the sizes of the differences , the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test should be preferred. This test is also distribution free, but it is much more sensitive than the Sign-test. Finally, the Sign-test is an almost ideal quick-and-dirty test that can be used to browse datasets or to check the results of other tests (e.g., as in: "All six subjects show an increase, so why does your test insist that p > 0.05?").

<i>Characteristics:</i><br>
Crudest and most insensitive test. It is also the most convincing and
easiest to apply. The level of significance can almost be estimated
without the help of a calculator or table. If the Sign-test indicates a
significant difference, and another test does not, you should seriously
rethink whether the other test is valid.
<p><i>H0:</i><br>
The median value of the distribution is <i>m</i> (generally <i>m</i> = 0), 
values larger (+) and smaller (-) than the median are equally likely.<br> 
When matched pairs are used, the probability of observing (A, B) is
equal to that of observing (B, A) and the value of A-B has median value 0.

<p><i>Assumptions:</i><br>
None other than H0.

<p><i>Scale:</i><br>
Ordinal, but sometimes nominal when it is used as a binomial test

<p><i>Procedure:</i><br>
Label observations as +/-, positive/negative, greater/smaller, left/right, 
black/white, male/female, or whatever dichotomy you want to use and count the 
number of times each label is observed. n+ is the number of times a "+" is 
observed and n- the number of times a "-" is observed. 
Ignore all <i>zero</i> or <i>equal</i> observations.

<p><i>Level of Significance:</i><br>
n+ and n- are 
<a href=/Service/Statistics/Binomial_distribution.html>
binomial distributed</a> with <i>p</i> = <i>q</i> = 1/2
and <i>N</i> = (n+) + (n-).<br>
If k is the smaller of (n+) and (n-) then:<br>
p <= 2 * Sum (i=0 to k) {<i>N</i>!/(i!*(<i>N</i>-i)!)}/4<br>
(with k! = k*(k-1)*(k-2)*...*1 is the factorial of k and 0! = 1)

<p><i>Approximation:</i><br>
If (n+) + (n-) = <i>N</i> > 25, then 
<i>Z</i> = (| n+ - n- | - 1)/sqrt( <i>N</i> ) 
can be approximated with a 
<a href=/Service/Statistics/Normal-Z_distribution.html>
Standard Normal distribution</a>. In our example, we calculate the exact 
probabilities upto <i>N</i> = 100.<br>
For <i>N</i> > 30, the 
<a href="/Service/Statistics/Student_t_Test.html">
Student t-test</a> can be used. However, the 
<a href="/Service/Statistics/Signed_Rank_Test.html">
Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks</a> test is a better alternative.

<p><i>Remarks:</i><br>
The Sign-test answers the question: <i>How often?</i>, whereas other
tests answer the question <i>How much?</i>. It must be kept in mind that
these two questions might have different answers.<br>
When the problem concerns the <em>sizes</em> of the <em>differences</em>, 
the <a href=/Service/Statistics/Signed_Rank_Test.html>
Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test</a> should be preferred. This test 
is also distribution free, but it is much more sensitive than the Sign-test.<br> 
Finally, the Sign-test is an almost ideal <i>quick-and-dirty</i> test that 
can be used to browse datasets or to check the results of other tests 
(e.g., as in: "All six subjects show an increase, so why does your test
insist that p > 0.05?").
