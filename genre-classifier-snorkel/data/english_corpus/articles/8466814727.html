Kirkpatrick <A HREF="node48.html#b40">[40]</A> has described SA as ``an
example of an evolutionary  process  modeled  accurately  by  purely
stochastic  means,''  but this is more literally true of another class
of  new  optimization  routines  known   collectively   as   Genetic
Algorithms  (GAs).  These  attempt  to  simulate  the  phenomenon of
natural  evolution  first  observed  by  Darwin  <A HREF="node48.html#b12">[12]</A>  and  recently
elaborated  by  Dawkins  <A HREF="node48.html#b14">[14]</A>.
<P>
In  natural  evolution each species
searches for beneficial adaptations in an ever-changing environment.
As   species   evolve  these  new  attributes  are  encoded  in  the
chromosomes of individual members. This information does  change  by
random  mutation,  but  the  real  driving force behind evolutionary
development is the combination and exchange of chromosomal  material
during  breeding.
<P>
Although  sporadic attempts to incorporate these
principles in optimization routines have been made since  the  early
1960s  (see  a review in Chapter 4 of Goldberg <A HREF="node48.html#b31">[31]</A>), GAs were first
established on a sound theoretical basis by Holland  <A HREF="node48.html#b37">[37]</A>.  The  two
key  axioms  underlying  this  innovative work were that complicated
nonbiological structures could be described by  simple  bit  strings
and  that  these  structures could be improved by the application of
simple  transformations  to  these   strings.
<P>
GAs   differ   from
traditional  optimization  algorithms in four important respects:
<UL><LI> They work using an encoding of the control  variables,  rather  than
the  variables  themselves.

solutions to another, rather than from individual to individual. 
<LI> They  use  only  objective function information, not derivatives.

Of course,  GAs  share  the  last  two  attributes  with  SA  and,  not

from the standard optimization routine flow diagram is  the  use  of
the   word   `population'  rather  than  `solution.'  A  more  major
difference is that the usual operation of generating a new  solution
has   been  replaced  by  three  separate  activities - population
selection, recombination  and  mutation.
