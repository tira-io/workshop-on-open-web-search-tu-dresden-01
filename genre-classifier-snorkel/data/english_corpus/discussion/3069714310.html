January 24, 2004 Rock & Roll Never Forgets Rock Confidential By Coral Amende, Plume Books, Penguin Books, Ltd, 2000. I bought this book for my teenage son several years ago, probably more to show him how hip a Baby Boomer I was than for his edification. Taking a look-through before I gave it to him, I realized it was too full of sex, drugs, and rock and roll for his tender sensibilities. But not for mine. Subtitled "A Backstage Pass to the Outrageous World of Rock 'n Roll," this may be one of the sleaziest, most scurrilous books I ever loved. Rock Confidential is a sordid and highly entertaining shuffle down memory's back alley. The book is out of print but you may be able to find a used copy of Rock Confidential at Amazon. Enlighten me, oh rock star: "Getting old is a fascinating thing. The older you get, the older you want to get." Keith Richards "Reporting I'm drunk is like saying there was a Tuesday last week." Grace Slick "I'm saving the bass player for Omaha." Janis Joplin "Everybody got it wrong. I said I was into porn again, not born again." Billy Idol "Everybody's colored--or else you wouldn't be able to see them." Captain Beefheart on racism "I don't know anything about music. In my line, you don't have to." Elvis Presley "Just because I cut the heads off dolls, they say I must hate babies. But it's not true--I just hate dolls." Alice Cooper "Knowing me, I'll probably get busted at my own funeral."

December 20, 2003 Randy The Red-Eyed Hippie Over thirty years ago, a Boomer friend wrote this adaptation of a Christmas favorite. No doubt feeling the effects of some illicit drug themselves, this tune (sung to the music of "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer") was a late-night collaboration by the counselors at a summer camp. In fact, it was so "catchy" I only heard it once and remembered it all these years. I guess the brain decides for itself what's important. Randy The Red-Eyed Hippie" Randy the red-eyed hippie had some very glassy eyes and if you ever saw him you would be so surprised. All of the other hippies used to laugh and call him names they wouldn't let poor Randy smoke and toke in any of their games Then one smoky party night Randy freaked them out, he showed up with ten whole pounds and blew their minds right out Now all the hippies love him as they smoke and toke with glee Randy the red-eyed hippie pass the freakin' joint to me.

December 18, 2003 A Very Baby Boomer Christmas Virgin Records is courting a re-marriage with Baby Boomers and "follow the money" seems to be an apt suggestion. Many retailers are trying to stop the bleeding and Virgin is leading the way with innovative displays designed to wrench every last dollar out of Boomers. From The Arizona Republic: "This week, shoppers in the company's Virgin Megastore in San Francisco will find jars of English marmalade and Yellow Submarine lunch boxes alongside Beatles CDs, and jazz magazines next to Miles Davis tunes. Lucille Ball T-shirts and Cher memorabilia will appear in a new gay-lifestyle section, and scented bath oils and self-help books will be packaged with music for yoga enthusiasts." "Twist & Shout, with its eclectic mix of products ranging from retro candy and Jimi Hendrix T-shirts to Bart Simpson characters and irreverent bumper stickers, has done for the past 16 years what Virgin is attempting to do." "The baby boomers are the ones who made rock and roll a phenomenon in the first place," he said. "A lot of other places forgot that, and now they're having to work extra hard to repair the damage." Damage? I've already got all the music I care about. I suppose the only thing left is to peddle t-shirts and lunchboxes. Hey music industry, how about some new music for the people (read Baby Boomers) who actually BUY music. UPDATE: Here's a rather cutting review of of what to give your "Aging Hipster" this holiday season: "...disenfranchised citizens of the post-Woodstock Nation grow conspicuously fat and bald, please forgive them for failing to move on. Surely, somebody realizes that graying boomers comprise a significant demographic, because on this Yuletide, enterprising retailers have unveiled a provocative line of gifts aimed at 40- and 50-somethings who cut their musical teeth on lots of Hendrix and perhaps a bit of herb. Or was it a little Hendrix and lots of herb?!" And if that wasn't enough to get you singing an old familiar tune, Amazon has jumped into the fray with their own list of Baby Boomer favs: Amazon Listmania. But frankly, "All On A Wintry Night: A Judy Collins Christmas" scares the living hell out of me. Posted by Pete at 08:53 AM Permanent Link (?)

September 10, 2003 Baby boomers morph into concert undead "Remaining welded to his chair, he sat motionless, staring at the stage. I was almost ready to summon a "CSI" squad until I noticed that his hands actually moved a few times to clap. Yes, he was breathing, but he definitely was not alive. At least not in the Springsteen sense of the word." Chuck Barney of the Contra Costa Times describes the living dead at a Springsteen concert. "Much has been made of how baby boomers are flocking to live concerts these days, helping to keep afloat their old-time faves such as the Rolling Stones, Fleetwood Mac and others. The sad truth, though, is that many of these boomers have forgotten how to rock." He may be right! Read the entire article and feel the shame. The Undead Have you seen the undead? Tell us about it.

August 22, 2003 In the Garden of Eden, Baby Most Baby Boomers either loved it or hated it. Whichever, In-a-Gadda-da-Vida occupied (and still does on Flashback Lane) a unique place in rockology. Maybe I knew what the song was about at some hazy point in time, but these days I had to go to the web to look for answers. I found the following on the Phrasefinder bulletin boards. (By the way a great site when you have to know what...well...in a gadda da vida means.) "As I remember, the phrase means, In The Garden of Eden Don't you know that I love you He wrote it In A Gadda Da Vida because it was easier to sing, and it allowed him to be covertly religious, rather than overt about it. A lot of Rock and Role has obscure religious overtones. REM has the song, "Losing My Religion" which gives an obscure but obvious religious message. "Stairway To Heaven" does the same thing. In A Gadda Da Vida allowed Iron Butterfly to talk about the perfected paradise where they would meet the most beautiful woman in creation, but they would also have no moral or ethical responsibility to live a good and holy life." Erik Braunn, Iron Butterfly Guitarist, Dies at 52 By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS LOS ANGELES, July 29 - Erik Braunn, the Iron Butterfly guitarist who played one of rock's most recognizable riffs in the 17-minute anthem "In-a-Gadda-da-Vida," died here on Friday. He was 52. The cause was cardiac arrest, his family said. Mr. Braunn, who was born in Pekin, Ill., and raised in Los Angeles, was a violin prodigy who began his musical career at 4. He joined the heavy-metal band Iron Butterfly when he was 16 and toured with it from 1967 to 1969, when the group was enjoying its greatest success.

Get ready to dust off the vinyl because they're back with a fresh studio album and a new distribution channel. Original tracks are one thing, but when independent artists use the power of the Internet to bypass the traditional record company marketing machine, it's significant. According to Eric Olsen of www.blogcritics.org "One of the most important, celebrated cult bands of the '70s, Glass Harp, has reunited for its first studio album in 30 years. Hourglass , to be released in August, is 16 brand-new songs convincingly updating a timeless sound. A classic power trio and one of the original jam bands, Glass Harp is world-renowned guitarist Phil Keaggy, bassist Daniel Pecchio, and drummer John Sferra. All members sing and write, crafting a unique sound equal parts Cream, CSNY, Allman Brothers, James Gang, and Traffic with the talent and chops to transcend the comparisons and a profound spirituality to nourish the soul." www.blogcritics.org has some MP3 samples and exclusive electronic rights to the first four songs of the new album.

It sure ain't Woodstock. According to this article on the Canada.com website, baby boomers still love a rock concert--except now we want comfort, reserved seats, and polished performances. Not only that, seems boomers flock to concerts by dusty old groups like the Guess Who, who are apparently making more money in concert than they did decades ago. Maybe that's only Canadians. Some of us have actually stood in the rain to rock out to the Allman Brothers or waited on line for tickets to a local blues festival. Of course, a reserved patch of weeds close to the front would've helped. Posted by Jan at 10:41 AM Permanent Link (?)

February 09, 2003 Country Music: Is It Rock & Roll Or Just Travis Tritt? So here we are, rock 'n rollers from way back. Aren't we the generation that listened to 6 hour Grateful Dead jams, ,earsplitting Led Zeppelin, subversive Rolling Stones? Weren't ours the record collections that were so psychedelic you couldn't even read the lettering on the covers? One of us is not even ashamed to admit she waited for 48 hours on a cold city sidewalk for Rolling Stones Tickets. Why then, have so many of us turned in our Frye boots for cowboy boots? Why are we two-stepping instead of toking? Why, as Alan Jackson put it have Boomers "gone country?" There are many theories about country music's popularity. For one, country isn't quite as...well, country as it used to be. There probably isn't one song on the country charts that has lyrics about freight trains, prison, or dead dogs. (Note-pickup trucks seem to have replaced trains as the vehicles of choice.) And, as some purists note, not many country performers today have the absolute vibrant purity of a Kitty Wells or Patsy Cline or the sheer originality of Hank Williams. Country (or modern country as it is now called) is nothing like what you remember form the 60's and 70's. Were not talking about Porter Waggoner or Conway Twitty. Today's country features artists raised when Rock & Roll was king of the airwaves. To some extent, they bring a fresh new approach to country, one based in the history of American folk music and influenced by a generation of rockers. Also, the lines have blurred between country and rock.We had a taste of what was to come with the popularity of bands like Charlie Daniels, The Allman Brothers and The Marshall Tucker Band. The term "Southern Rock" was an attempt to label these bands as something other than country, but it gave rise to a revolution in country music. A rocking country singer like Travis Tritt is not so far removed from country rockers like Lynard Skynard. The ballads of "California rockers" like the Eagles and Poco are pure country. Sing "Desperado" with a twang and you have country. Another interesting theory would have it that we boomers, hitting middle-age, are so depressed , self-absorbed, and downright whiny, that the only music that suits us is good ole cry-in-your-beer-tear-your-heart-out country. After all, a generation that made Carole King and James Taylor stars is a natural for the rampant emotionality of country music . Admittedly, there isn't much exciting on the Boomer radio dial. It seems all those lyrical, melodic tunes of the 60's and 70's never grew into anything meaningful enough to recognize. And rock- and -roll as we knew it has morphed into that headbanger stuff our teenagers listen to. In the faceless world of "Rock & Roll," the few significant artists are easy to pick out of an undefined wasteland where the musical icons of our generation remain simply to attract an older audience. It would appear that even the recording industry recognizes the wilderness they have created. Go into any music retailer today; a huge amount of their business is devoted to converting vinyl into digital. The thousands of boomer titles now available on CD are overshadowing the apparent lack of excitement in the industry and propping up sales figures. It's not surprising then, that Country has gained a following among musically disenchanted boomers. So, if country music is your thang, you're not alone. And if you haven't tried it yet, pour yourself a beer, adjust that radio dial, and prepare to be hooked. .. or not.

Or, many of us knew most of the words, or lots of us knew at least a few of the words. One line of this song became particularly famous when it was taken by the radical underground, the Weathermen, who agreed with Dylan that "you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows." In our opinion, this was a great song on an album of great songs, Bringing It All Back Home, recorded in 1965.

We Came, We Saw, Our Feet Hurt OK--first imagine this. You're off to a day at a museum. You approach an imposing angled and jutting glass building-You cross a stone esplanade flanked by the usual plantings, the usual signage, the usual strategically placed stone seating areas. -could be any civic building in any medium size American city. And then, yikes!! Blasting from speakers placed around the plaza is...wait, could it be? Marvin Gaye and Tammy Terrell singing "Ain't No Mountain High Enough?!" Talk about your cognitive dissonance. You have arrived at the Rock and Roll Museum and Hall of Fame. The second clue that this isn't your mother's museum outing may be the crowd--everyone looks like someone you might have gone to college with. Everyone is in jeans. Some have brought their children to make the pilgrimage. Right from the door, we expected great things. Perhaps our expectations were too high. At first glance, I.M. Pei's building is impressive. From the lobby, it soars through five stories of glass, steel, cantilevered escalators, and views of Lake Erie and Cleveland's less-than-inspiring skyline. The entrance level generates excitement. This is gonna be big fun--a whole museum dedicated to rock and roll. It's a wonder that the place exists at all. The first exhibit, however, is in what can only be called the basement. From a central open area, the crowd is funneled through dark tunnel-like hallways flanked with hanging exhibits in no particular order. Each mini-exhibit is behind glass and mixes silly mannequin figures with genuinely interesting stuff like guitars, original sheet music, play lists. The combo platter of the sublime and ridiculous has some high points--Bo Diddly's homemade box guitar, John Lennon's school report card, the Rolling Stones food and drink order on tour, songs later to become hits scrawled on scraps of paper, for instance. We do hope that the collection of Michael Jackson mannequins as he slowly turned into Diana Ross was there more for comic relief. Don't get us wrong--if this had been the hors d'oeuvre tray, it would've been an excellent overview. We searched in vain and through five floors for the main course. There wasn't one. There were excellent photographs of performers, interesting videos of Hall of Fame induction ceremonies, some kind of interesting album art, a radio studio broadcasting live, and not much else. Granted, we were there while several sections of the museum were closed while they install their very first in-depth temporary exhibit, a look at the 60's Psychedelic Years. Optimisitc fans can only hope there will be many more in-depth exhibits to come. The Hall of Fame itself is on the sixth floor, which is reached by climbing a spiral staircase into a dark rotunda. A dark hushed rotunda. Built into the walls are monitors showing still photographs and signatures of the inductees, along with brief quotes about them. Period. No artifacts, no audio, no video. In fact, it looked more like a memorial to dead minor politicians than a celebration of that most subversive of musical forms. One has to wonder,"What were they thinking?!" In fact, the whole museum leads to that question. It seems the curatorial philosophy of the place is to treat rock and roll as a serious museum subject, no different than, say, the postage stamp museum. It could work if there were in-depth exhibits, room to roam, some sort of chronology, and the chance to learn something one didn't actually know before. Part of the problem for those of us of a certain age is that we remember this stuff--we're too close to it. There isn't enough scholarship to teach us something new or enough fun to make it a giant group flashback. It would be interesting to hear reactions from people who somehow either slept through the last three decades or are too young to remember them. If you're planning a pilgrimage despite our lukewarm review, be sure to check out the museum's web site . In fact, if you're not planning a pilgrimage, go to the web site anyway--in many ways it's easier to navigate and more comprehensive than the museum itself.

By Coral Amende, Plume Books, Penguin Books, Ltd, 2000.</p>

<p>I bought this book for my teenage son several years ago, probably more to show him how hip a Baby Boomer I was than for his edification. Taking a look-through before I gave it to him, I realized it was too full of sex, drugs, and rock and roll for his tender sensibilities. But not for mine. Subtitled "A Backstage Pass to the Outrageous World of Rock 'n Roll," this may be one of the sleaziest, most scurrilous books I ever loved.  Rock Confidential is a sordid and highly entertaining shuffle down memory's back alley.</p>

<p>The book is out of print but you may be able to find a used copy of <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=babyboomerhom-20&path=tg/detail/-/0452281571/qid%3D1074876707/sr%3D1-1">Rock Confidential</A> at Amazon.</p>

            <span class="boomer2"><p>Over thirty years ago, a Boomer friend wrote this adaptation of a Christmas favorite. No doubt feeling the effects of some illicit drug themselves, this tune (sung to the music of "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer") was a late-night collaboration by the counselors at a summer camp.</p>

<p>In fact, it was so "catchy" I only heard it once and remembered it all these years. I guess the brain decides for itself what's important.</p>

<p><B>Randy The Red-Eyed Hippie"</b></p>

<p>Randy the red-eyed hippie<br />
had some very glassy eyes<br />
and if you ever saw him<br />
you would be so surprised.</p>

<p>All of the other hippies<br />
used to laugh and call him names<br />
they wouldn't let poor Randy<br />
smoke and toke in any of their games</p>

<p>Then one smoky party night<br />
Randy freaked them out,<br />
he showed up with ten whole pounds<br />
and blew their minds right out</p>

<p>Now all the hippies love him<br />
as they smoke and toke with glee<br />
Randy the red-eyed hippie<br />
pass the freakin' joint to me.<br />

It's a pretty odd hankering for a Jewish girl, but what can I say? Gimme Elvis singing Blue Christmas and I start looking for some mistletoe to stand under.

            </span>  <h3 class="boomer"><strong><img src="http://www.aginghipsters.com/images/Red.GIF" Alt="a red Boomer button"> A Very Baby Boomer Christmas</strong></h3>
            <span class="boomer2"><p>Virgin Records is courting a re-marriage with Baby Boomers and "follow the money" seems to be an apt suggestion.  Many retailers are trying to stop the bleeding and Virgin is leading the way with innovative displays designed to wrench every last dollar out of Boomers.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/arizonaliving/articles/1203boomers.html" target="_blank">The Arizona Republic: </a>"This week, shoppers in the company's Virgin Megastore in San Francisco will find jars of English marmalade and Yellow Submarine lunch boxes alongside Beatles CDs, and jazz magazines next to Miles Davis tunes. Lucille Ball T-shirts and Cher memorabilia will appear in a new gay-lifestyle section, and scented bath oils and self-help books will be packaged with music for yoga enthusiasts."</p>

<p>"Twist & Shout, with its eclectic mix of products ranging from retro candy and Jimi Hendrix T-shirts to Bart Simpson characters and irreverent bumper stickers, has done for the past 16 years what Virgin is attempting to do."</p>

<p> "The baby boomers are the ones who made rock and roll a phenomenon in the first place," he said. "A lot of other places forgot that, and now they're having to work extra hard to repair the damage." </p>

<p>Damage? I've already got all the music I care about. I suppose the only thing left is to peddle t-shirts and lunchboxes. Hey music industry, how about some new music for the people (read Baby Boomers) who actually BUY music.</p>

<p><B>UPDATE:</b> <a href="http://indyweek.com/durham/2002-12-18/music.html"> Here's</a> a rather cutting review of of what to give your "Aging Hipster" this holiday season:</p>

<p> "...disenfranchised citizens of the post-Woodstock Nation grow conspicuously fat and bald, please forgive them for failing to move on. Surely, somebody realizes that graying boomers comprise a significant demographic, because on this Yuletide, enterprising retailers have unveiled a provocative line of gifts aimed at 40- and 50-somethings who cut their musical teeth on lots of Hendrix and perhaps a bit of herb. Or was it a little Hendrix and lots of herb?!"</p>

<p>And if that wasn't enough to get you singing an old familiar tune, Amazon has jumped into the fray with their own list of Baby Boomer favs:<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/listmania/list-browse/-/BTWPICLST27R/103-1100187-2547858">Amazon Listmania.</a> But frankly, "All On A Wintry Night: A Judy Collins Christmas" scares the living hell out of me.</p></span> <BR><span class="boomer"> <font size="-2">Posted

            <span class="boomer2"><p>Most Baby Boomers either loved it or hated it. Whichever, In-a-Gadda-da-Vida occupied (and still does on Flashback Lane) a unique place in rockology. Maybe I knew what the song was about at some hazy point in time, but these days I had to go to the web to look for answers. I found the following on the <a href=" http://phrases.shu.ac.uk/">Phrasefinder</a> bulletin boards. (By the way a great site when you have to know what...well...in a gadda da vida means.)</p>

<p>"As I remember, the phrase means,</p>

<p>In The Garden of Eden<br />
Don't you know that I love you</p>

<p>He wrote it In A Gadda Da Vida because it was easier to sing, and it allowed him to be covertly religious, rather than overt about it. A lot of Rock and Role has obscure religious overtones. REM has the song, "Losing My Religion" which<br />
gives an obscure but obvious religious message.  "Stairway To Heaven" does the same thing. </p>

<p>In A Gadda Da Vida allowed Iron Butterfly to talk about the perfected paradise where they would meet the most beautiful woman in creation, but they would also have no moral or ethical responsibility to live a good and holy life."</p>

<p><B>Erik Braunn, Iron Butterfly Guitarist, Dies at 52</B><br />
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS</p>

<p>LOS ANGELES, July 29 - Erik Braunn, the Iron Butterfly guitarist who played one of rock's most recognizable riffs in the 17-minute anthem "In-a-Gadda-da-Vida," died here on Friday. He was 52.</p>

<p>The cause was cardiac arrest, his family said.</p>

<p>Mr. Braunn, who was born in Pekin, Ill., and raised in Los Angeles, was a violin prodigy who began his musical career at 4. He joined the heavy-metal band Iron Butterfly when he was 16 and toured with it from 1967 to 1969, when the group was enjoying its greatest success.</p>

<p>You aging hipsters out there might remember Glass Harp, the 70's cult band featuring guitarist Phil Keaggy. Get ready to dust off the vinyl because they're back with a fresh studio album and a new distribution channel. Original tracks are one thing, but when independent artists use the power of the Internet to bypass the traditional record company marketing machine, it's significant. </p>

<p>According to Eric Olsen of <a href="http://www.blogcritics.org/archives/2003/07/11/101002.php">www.blogcritics.org</a> "One of the most important, celebrated cult bands of the '70s, Glass Harp, has reunited for its first studio album in 30 years. <i>Hourglass</i>, to be released in August, is 16 brand-new songs convincingly updating a timeless sound.</p>

<p>A classic power trio and one of the original jam bands, Glass Harp is world-renowned guitarist Phil Keaggy, bassist Daniel Pecchio, and drummer John Sferra. All members sing and write, crafting a unique sound equal parts Cream, CSNY, Allman Brothers, James Gang, and Traffic with the talent and chops to transcend the comparisons and a profound spirituality to nourish the soul."</p>

<p>www.blogcritics.org has some <a href="http://www.blogcritics.org/archives/2003/07/11/101002.php">MP3 samples</a> and exclusive electronic rights to the first four songs of the new album.

            <span class="boomer2"><p>It sure ain't Woodstock. According to <a href=http://www.canada.com/montreal/specials/business/story.html?id=82ED33A1-CFD9-4FDC-B5CC-81796093102A>this article</a> on the Canada.com website, baby boomers still love a rock concert--except now we want comfort, reserved seats, and polished performances. Not only that, seems boomers flock to concerts by dusty old groups like the Guess Who, who are apparently making more money in concert than they did decades ago.</p>

<p>Maybe that's only Canadians. Some of us have actually stood in the rain to rock out to the Allman Brothers or waited on line for tickets to a local blues festival. Of course, a reserved patch of weeds close to the front would've helped.</p></span> <BR><span class="boomer"> <font size="-2">Posted

            </span>  <h3 class="boomer"><strong><img src="http://www.aginghipsters.com/images/Red.GIF" Alt="a red Boomer button"> Country Music: Is It Rock & Roll Or Just Travis Tritt?</strong></h3>
            <span class="boomer2"><IMG SRC="http://www.aginghipsters.com/trisha1.gif" align="left"> So here we are, rock 'n rollers from way back. Aren't we the

generation that listened to 6 hour Grateful Dead jams, 

,earsplitting Led Zeppelin, subversive Rolling Stones? Weren't

ours the record collections that were so psychedelic you

couldn't even read the lettering on the covers? One of us is not

even ashamed to admit she waited for 48 hours on a cold city

sidewalk for Rolling Stones Tickets. Why then, have so many of

us turned in our Frye boots for cowboy boots? Why are we

two-stepping instead of toking?  Why, as Alan Jackson put it

have Boomers "gone country?" 



<P>



 There are many theories about country music's popularity. For

one, country isn't quite as...well, country as it used to be.

There probably isn't one song on the country charts that has

lyrics about freight trains, prison,  or dead dogs. (Note-pickup

trucks seem to have replaced trains as the vehicles of choice.)

And, as some purists note, not many country performers today

have the absolute vibrant purity of a Kitty Wells or Patsy Cline

or the sheer originality of Hank Williams.

<P>

Country (or modern country as it is now called) is nothing like

what you remember form the 60's and 70's. Were not talking about

Porter Waggoner or Conway Twitty. Today's country features

artists raised when Rock & Roll  was king of the airwaves. To

some extent, they bring a fresh new approach to country, one

based in the history of American folk music and influenced by a

generation of rockers.



<P>



 Also, the lines have blurred between country and rock.We had a

taste of what was to come with the popularity of bands like

Charlie Daniels, The Allman Brothers and The Marshall Tucker

Band. The term "Southern Rock" was an attempt to label these

bands as something other than country, but it gave rise to a

revolution in country music.  A rocking country singer like

Travis Tritt is not so far removed from country rockers like

Lynard Skynard. The ballads of "California

rockers" like the Eagles and Poco are pure country.  Sing

"Desperado" with a twang and you have country.



<P>



 Another interesting theory would have it that we boomers,

hitting middle-age, are so depressed , self-absorbed, and

downright whiny, that the only music that suits us is good ole

cry-in-your-beer-tear-your-heart-out country. After all, a

generation that made Carole King and James Taylor  stars is a

natural for the rampant emotionality of country music .



 <P>



Admittedly, there isn't much exciting on the Boomer radio dial.

It seems all those lyrical, melodic tunes of the 60's and 70's

never grew into anything meaningful enough to recognize.  And

rock- and -roll as we knew it has morphed into that headbanger

stuff our teenagers listen to. In the faceless world of "Rock &

Roll,"  the few significant artists are easy to pick out of an

undefined wasteland where the musical icons of our generation

remain simply to attract an older audience.





<P>

 It would appear that even the recording industry recognizes the

wilderness they have created. Go into any music retailer today;

a huge amount of their business is devoted to converting vinyl

into digital. The thousands of boomer titles now available on CD

are overshadowing the apparent lack of excitement in the

industry and propping up sales figures. It's not surprising

then, that Country has gained a following among musically

disenchanted boomers. 



<P>



So, if country music is your thang, you're not alone. And if you

haven't tried it yet, pour yourself a beer, adjust that radio

dial, and prepare to be hooked. .. or not.

Note: It pains us to report that the biggest hit of the

Seventies was not a disco song, but Debby Boone's You Light Up

My Life. We dare you to admit you liked THAT song.

            </span>  <h3 class="boomer"><strong><img src="http://www.aginghipsters.com/images/Red.GIF" Alt="a red Boomer button"> Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. We Came, We Saw, Our Feet Hurt</strong></h3>
            <span class="boomer2"><p>OK--first imagine this. You're off to a day at a museum. You approach an imposing angled and jutting glass building-You cross a stone esplanade flanked by the usual plantings, the usual signage, the usual strategically placed stone seating areas. -could be any civic building in any medium size American city. And then, yikes!! Blasting from speakers placed around the plaza is...wait, could it be? Marvin Gaye and Tammy Terrell singing "Ain't No Mountain High Enough?!" Talk about your cognitive dissonance. You have arrived at the Rock and Roll Museum and Hall of Fame. The second clue that this isn't your mother's museum outing may be the crowd--everyone looks like someone you might have gone to college with. Everyone is in <img src="http://www.aginghipsters.com/images/hof2.jpg" align="left">jeans. Some have brought their children to make the pilgrimage. Right from the door, we expected great things. Perhaps our expectations were too high. </p>

<p>At first glance, I.M. Pei's building is impressive. From the lobby, it soars through five stories of glass, steel, cantilevered escalators, and views of Lake Erie and Cleveland's less-than-inspiring skyline. The entrance level generates excitement. This is gonna be big fun--a whole museum dedicated to rock and roll. It's a wonder that the place exists at all. The first exhibit, however, is in what can only be called the basement. From a central open area, the crowd is funneled through dark tunnel-like hallways flanked with hanging exhibits in no particular order. Each mini-exhibit is behind glass and mixes silly mannequin figures with genuinely interesting stuff like guitars, original sheet music, play lists. The combo platter of the sublime and ridiculous has some high points--Bo Diddly's homemade box guitar, John Lennon's school report card, the Rolling Stones food and drink order on tour, songs later to become hits scrawled on scraps of paper, for instance. We do hope that the collection of Michael Jackson mannequins as he slowly turned into Diana Ross was there more for comic relief. </p>

<p>Don't get us wrong--if this had been the hors d'oeuvre tray, it would've been an excellent overview. We searched in vain and through five floors for the main course. There wasn't one. There were excellent photographs of performers, interesting videos of Hall of Fame induction ceremonies, some kind of interesting album art, a radio studio broadcasting live, and not much else. Granted, we were there while several sections of the museum were closed while they install their very first in-depth temporary exhibit, a look at the 60's Psychedelic Years. Optimisitc fans can only hope there will be many more in-depth exhibits to come. </p>

<p>The Hall of Fame itself is on the sixth floor, which is reached by climbing a spiral staircase into a dark rotunda. A dark hushed rotunda. Built into the walls are monitors showing still photographs and signatures of the inductees, along with brief quotes about them. Period. No artifacts, no audio, no video. In fact, it looked more like a memorial to dead minor politicians than a celebration of that most subversive of musical forms. One has to wonder,"What were they thinking?!" </p>

<p>In fact, the whole museum leads to that question. It seems the curatorial philosophy of the place is to treat rock and roll as a serious museum subject, no different than, say, the postage stamp museum. It could work if there were in-depth exhibits, room to roam, some sort of chronology, and the chance to learn something one didn't actually know before. Part of the problem for those of us of a certain age is that we remember this stuff--we're too close to it. There isn't enough scholarship to teach us something new or enough fun to make it a giant group flashback. It would be interesting to hear reactions from people who somehow either slept through the last three decades or are too young to remember them. </p>

<p>If you're planning a pilgrimage despite our lukewarm review, be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.rockhall.com">museum's web site </a>. <br />
In fact, if you're not planning a pilgrimage, go to the web site anyway--in many ways it's easier to navigate and more comprehensive than the museum itself. </p>
