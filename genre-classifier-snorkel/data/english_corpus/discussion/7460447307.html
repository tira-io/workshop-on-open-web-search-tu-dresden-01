Search Forum Index Recipe Search Page 1 2 3 4 F. S.....Simple Pasta Salads 07/09/02 Do you have a simple to make pasta salad recipe? Bess W. Metcalf........Several of them 07/10/02 Pasta recipes are great for quick, cool meals in the summertime. You can sneak in all kinds of healthy ingredients, too. See some history and explanation of pasta types at Pasta Lovers: Pay Attention . I tend to use tri-color spirals or radiatore, and throw in whatever cooked or raw veggies I have on hand. Here's some sample salads with a hint at the end: Hawaiian Salad Deli Pasta Salad Summer Vegetable Pasta Salad Macaroni &amp; Tuna Salad Bow-Tie Pasta Salad with Tuna Fish by Karen Danielson Broccoli &amp; Tortellini Salad (**All Recipes) Salsa Pasta Salad (**All Recipes) 17 Pasta Salads (** RecipeAmerica) Labor Day Pasta Salad (** Recipe Source) Primavera Pasta Salad (** Honey.com) Greek Pasta Salad Greek Pasta Salad (** Granny's Recipes) Oriental Pasta Salad (** Salad Savoy) Salmon Pasta Salad (** Cooking Cache) Salmon and Pasta Salad (**Recipe Du Jour) Ginger-Peanut Pasta Salad Chinese Chicken &amp; Pasta Salad (** The Gutsy Gourmet) BLT Pasta Salad (** Parents.com) Sweet &amp; Sour Pasta Salad (** 24-Hour Fitness) Sicilian Pasta Salad (** Chef Older) These should keep you fortified for the summer. By the way, if you have latch-key kids, you don't want them carrying a pot of boiling water to the sink and trying to pour out and drain hot pasta. But it takes a while when you get home to boil the water, cook the pasta, then drain and cool it. Your child who's old enough to know stove safety can put on a large pot of water to heat. When it comes to a rolling boil (get them to set a timer as a reminder), pour in the pasta, stir a time or two until it comes back to a full boil, cover and turn off the heat. When it's cool enough that they can lay their hand on the side of the pan, they can drain it safely, pour into a bowl or Tupperware® container, mix in a tablespoon of olive oil to keep it from sticking together, and refrigerate to chill until you get home. Jim Traveler, cohort - oops - co-host of Great World Chefs 08/13/02 Bess: As you may or may not remember I authored a nasty paper about "crock pots". I said I kept leftover nuts and bolts and screws in my crock pot. Well I have cleaned it up and the Woolly Bear has told me I going to cook a roast in that pot. She bought a 2.5 lb. top sirloin roast, some Lipton Onion Soup mix, celery soup, and said, "Cook". I have no clue what to do, Help? Signed: Cookin' Jim PS: Don't tell Chef Al. He thinks I run things at home. Bess W. Metcalf....Crock Pot Roast 08/13/02 Ok, we won't tell ChefAl, who probably never had to deal with hungry kids, a job with a demanding boss, a dirty house, laundry and a cranky husband all at once - and fix dinner. (P.S. I'm with you.... I'm all for short cuts, but I kept junk -like in &quot;junk drawer&quot;- in mine for years before I gave it away.) See the Best Ever Pot Roast . (Why &quot;Woolly Bear&quot;, Jim.... why?) ChefAl of Great World Chefs .... .Woolly Bear 08/18/2002 Just a guess, but maybe the term "WoollyBear" has a connection with one's collection, and/or need, of luxurious FUR COATS ,.... .... What a crock.. . 08/22/02 Well, first - get some POT ,.... CROCKPOT, I mean ,..... then: POTATOES - small Yukon Golds work well ,..... some baby CARROTS ,..... a couple LEEKS ,..... any HERBS/SPICES you deem necessary ,..... some CELERY or PEPPERS wouldn't hurt ,..... the ONION SOUP MIX [to keep the Woolly Bear, happy!] ,..... oh yeah, the SIRLOIN TIP ROAST ,..... also - maybe a liter [or so], of the PINOT GRIS - for the CHEF - not the roast ,..... THEN: Add all to the CROCKPOT, put on the lid, then seal with DUCT TAPE! Put the crockpot in a hole in the backyard, cover with HOT CHARCOALS, and let cook until the GRIS is gone, and/or a 6-PACK,.... Get the POT outta the hole, and rinse off COMPLETELY, and let stand, for about 2 MARTINIS worth ,.... Put the POT on a large, deep platter/bowl, then take a big-ass HAMMER, and smash the POT ,..... Remove the shards of pot [it doesn't sliver - you will have big pieces, and the tape will hold much together] ,... You now have a delicious platter of meat and veggies and gravy ,.... and you got to DESTROY that old ****ing POT !!!!!!! Chef NOT Al Bess W. Metcalf.... Proof - high proof, apparently. Just goes to show that ingenuity is still alive and well among us. Maybe. What did you do with Woolly Bear's celery soup? ChefAl of Great World Chefs ... ..Omission of celery soup 08/25/02 Must have been a 'Freudian slip - omission' ,.... but does anyone really eat celery soup - even a Woolly Bear ??? Canned, or made from "scratch" ??? Yuuuuuck, I think! Bess W. Metcalf....What's wrong with celery soup? 08/27/02 What's wrong with celery soup, even condensed cream of celery? Just because you and I don't eat it doesn't mean it isn't a tasty treat! On the other hand..... Double Celery Soup from CyberKuali Boccaccio (Celery Soup) from Chef2Chef Apple &amp; Celery Soup from RecipeSource Curried Celery Soup from Seabreeze Organic Farm Cream of Celery from Gourmet Tips (page down to find) Someone besides Woolly Bear must like canned celery soup, as there are thousands - nay, hundreds of thousands -of recipes on the web that call for it. On the other hand, one of my distressing childhood memories was from when my parents were invited to dinner at a parishioner's house, and she served tuna fish casserole, which, I believe, contained nothing more that cooked elbow macaroni, cream of celery soup, canned peas and drained canned tuna fish, topped with crumbs and baked until nice and bubbly. Yeeech!!! ChefAl of Great World Chefs ..... Wha t next? OK, OK ,.... next you'll be telling me someone has a killer 'Creme de la ZUCCHINI' soup ,.... mmmmmm ! Maybe 'SQUASH CHOWDER' ,..... and you make fun of my sushi ,.... chef "no gourds" al Dreama...Turkey recipe from Dash detergent cookbook 10/02/02 During the mid-70s, there was a paper-back, letter-size, (about an inch+ thick) cookbook that either came with the box of Dash or as a mail-order item available by sending a check for unknown $ $ $ and perhaps box tops from Dash. My children demolished this cookbook many years ago and I would love to be able to obtain a replacement copy of this cookbook if at all possible. If the entire cookbook is no longer available, I would definitely like to at least be able to obtain a copy of a particular recipe that had been in that cookbook. I don't remember the name of the recipe or even all of the ingredients, but it did use uncooked, sliced turkey breast, dill, and mayo or perhaps it was sour cream. At any rate, it was sautéed in a skillet and the ingredients formed a sauce. Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Bess W. Metcalf.....Anybody out there! I have a huge collection of odd, old cookbooks but that's a new one. Anyone have this cookbook? Or saved the recipe? I've sent an inquiry to Proctor &amp; Gamble, who made Dash. This sometimes works. I had a much-loved paperback from Westinghouse in the sixties. About 12 years ago I lost all copies of a favorite recipe, and that page was gone from the book (how held together by a rubber band). An employee at Westinghouse had a copy and was so kind as to send me a copy of the recipe. There's always hope. Casey - USA P&amp;G Team....Sorry, No Cookbook 10/25/02 I'm sorry for the delay in responding. We were having this researched to see if we could find the information you requested. Unfortunately, we have no record of Dash detergent ever offering a cookbook. Sorry that I couldn't be more helpful.

CROCKPOT, I mean ,..... then:<br>
<br>
POTATOES - small Yukon Golds work well ,.....<br>
some baby CARROTS ,.....<br>
a couple LEEKS ,.....<br>
any HERBS/SPICES you deem necessary ,.....<br>
some CELERY or PEPPERS wouldn't hurt ,.....<br>
the ONION SOUP MIX [to keep the Woolly Bear, happy!] ,.....<br>
oh yeah, the SIRLOIN TIP ROAST ,.....<br>
also - maybe a liter [or so], of the PINOT GRIS - for the CHEF - not the roast ,.....&nbsp;<br>
<br>
THEN:<br>
<br>
Add all to the CROCKPOT, put on the lid, then seal with DUCT TAPE!<br>
<br>
Put the crockpot in a hole in the backyard, cover with HOT CHARCOALS, and let cook until the GRIS
is gone, and/or a 6-PACK,....<br>
<br>
Get the POT outta the hole, and rinse off COMPLETELY, and let stand, for about 2 MARTINIS worth ,....<br>
<br>
Put the POT on a large, deep platter/bowl, then take a big-ass HAMMER, and smash the POT ,.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Remove the shards of pot [it doesn't sliver - you will have big pieces, and the tape will hold much
together] ,...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You now have a delicious platter of meat and
veggies and gravy ,....<br>
<br>
and you got to DESTROY that old ****ing POT !!!!!!!<br>

peas and drained canned tuna fish, topped with crumbs and baked until nice and

<p><font face="Arial">During the mid-70s, there was a paper-back, letter-size, (about an inch+ thick) cookbook that either came with the box of Dash or as a mail-order item available by sending a check for unknown $$$ and perhaps box tops from Dash.<br>
<br>
My children demolished this cookbook many years ago and I would love to be able to obtain a replacement copy of this cookbook if at all possible.&nbsp;
If the entire cookbook is no longer available, I would definitely like to at least be able to obtain a copy of a particular recipe that had been in that cookbook.&nbsp;
I don't remember the name of the recipe or even all of the ingredients, but it did use uncooked, sliced turkey breast, dill, and mayo or perhaps it was sour cream.&nbsp;
At any rate, it was sautéed in a skillet and the ingredients formed a sauce.<br>
<br>
Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</font></p>

This sometimes works.&nbsp; I had a much-loved paperback from Westinghouse in
the sixties.&nbsp; About 12 years ago I lost all copies of a favorite recipe,
and that page was gone from the book (how held together by a rubber band).&nbsp;
An employee at Westinghouse had a copy and was so kind as to send me a copy of
the recipe.&nbsp; There's always hope.</font></p>
