 Xp pro boot problem Xp pro boot problem Forums &gt; SOFTWARE &gt; Operating Systems &gt; Xp pro boot problem Search Forums: Read With Formatting | Join The Community, Free! | Read Related Topics Operating Systems Thread: Xp pro boot problem sm007j2 I was wondering if anyone could help me with this. Windows gets to the screen that says windows did not load fully and you can choose safe more, load normally, etc. Whatever option I choose, the HD led just flashes for a brief moment the abrubtly stops and the os does not continue to load. I even tried a fresh install of xp, but it started doing it again. Could anyone give me any advice as to the causes/solutions to this problem. Thanks a lot. Become A Member, Free! Xp pro boot problem OCAKatana Fresh install of windows, without ANYTHING else? So no drivers, updates, anything? And you formatted before the new install? Have you added anything new recently (drivers/hardware)? Are you running RAID? Have you made any BIOS changes? Try resetting your BIOS via the jumper, bringing it down to stock speed if your OC'ing. Remove all unneccesary hardware (basically everything but the vid card). That's a good place to start. Read Related Topics Xp pro boot problem Visionism I was having a similar problem. CMOS resets worked but then it would only load Windows with the BIOS failsafe defaults set. After that I could reboot and put the BIOS back how it should be. Turned out my CMOS battery was going flat. Replaced it and its been smooth sailing ever since. Read Formatted Version Xp pro boot problem sm007j2 Hey guys thanks a lot for the help. I did do a clean reinstall of windows (formating before) and it did the same thing when i moved the fsb beyond default settings, even to 205 fsb. I used to run it at 251 fsb with no problems, but last night I got it stable at 259, so I rebooted to go into the bios to write down my settings, after which windows just stopped loading. It sounds like it's not a windows issue, because before I had gone as high as 262 fsb without any problems with windows loading, just last night it all of a sudden stopped. Do you think it's pretty clear it's the cmos battery here? Thanks again. See Attached Images Xp pro boot problem sm007j2 oh yeah, just to give you some more info. I'm not running raid and I havent added any new hardware or software. just the same stuff that i had been running that worked fine before. Become A Member, Free! Xp pro boot problem OCAKatana I understand you were able to overclock your FSB before. That doesn't mean it will be stable now. You need to try STOCK speeds and see if you can boot into Windows.
