A percent is a ratio of a number to 100. A percent can be expressed using the percent symbol %. Example: 10 percent or 10% are both the same, and stand for the ratio 10:100. Percent as a fraction A percent is equivalent to a fraction with denominator 100. Example: 5% of something = 5/100 of that thing. Example: 2 1/2% is equal to what fraction? Answer: 2 1/2% = (2 1/2)/100 = 5/200 = 1/40 Example: 52% most nearly equals which one of 1/2, 1/4, 2, 8, or 1/5? Answer: 52% = 52/100. This is very close to 50/100, or 1/2. Example: 13/25 is what %? We want to convert 13/25 to a fraction with 100 in the denominator: 13/25 = (13 &#215; 4)/(25 &#215; 4) = 52/100, so 13/25 = 52%. Alternatively, we could say: Let 13/25 be n %, and let us find n . Then 13/25 = n /100, so cross multiplying, 13 &#215; 100 = 25 &#215; n , so 25 n = 13 &#215; 100 = 1300. Then 25 n &#247 25 = 1300 &#247 25, so n = 1300 &#247 25 = 52. So 13/25 = n % = 52%. Example: 8/200 is what %? Method 1: 8/200 = (4 &#215; 2)/(100 &#215; 2), so 8/200 = 4/100 = 4%. Method 2: Let 8/200 be n%. Then 8/200 = n /100, so 200 &#215; n = 800, and 200 n &#247 200 = 800 &#247 200 = 4, so n % = 4%. Example: Write 80% as a fraction in lowest terms. 80% = 80/100, which is equal to 4/5 in lowest terms. Percent as a decimal Percent and hundredths are basically equivalent. This makes conversion between percent and decimals very easy. To convert from a decimal to a percent, just move the decimal 2 places to the right. For example, 0.15 = 15 hundredths = 15%. Example: 0.0006 = 0.06% Converting from percent to decimal form is similar, only you move the decimal point 2 places to the left. You must also be sure, before doing this, that the percentage itself is expressed in decimal form, without fractions. Example: Express 3% in decimal form. Moving the decimal 2 to the left (and adding in 0's to the left of the 3 as place holders,) we get 0.03. Example: Express 97 1/4% in decimal form. First we write 97 1/4 in decimal form: 97.25. Then we move the decimal 2 places to the left to get 0.9725, so 97 1/4% = 0.9725. This makes sense, since 97 1/4% is nearly 100%, and 0.9725 is nearly 1. Estimating percents When estimating percents, it is helpful to remember the fractional equivalent of some simple percents. 100% = 1 (100% of any number equals that number.) 50% = 1/2 = 0.5 (50% of any number equals half of that number.) 25% = 1/4 = 0.25 (25% of any number equals one-fourth of that number.) 10% = 1/10 = 0.1 (10% of any number equals one-tenth of that number.) 1% = 1/100 = 0.01 (1% of any number equals one-hundredth of that number.) Because it is very easy to switch between a decimal and a percent, estimating a percent is as easy as estimating a fraction as a decimal, and converting to a percent by multiplying by 100. Example: Estimate 19 as a percent of 80. As a fraction, 19/80 20/80 = 1/4 =0.25 = 25%. The step used to estimate the percent occurred when we estimated 19/80 as 20/80. The exact percent is actually 23.75%, so the estimate of 25% is only 1.25% off. (About 1 part in 100.) Example: Estimate 7 as a percent of 960. As a fraction, 7/960 7/100 = 0.007 = 0.7%. The step used to estimate the percent occurred when we estimated 7/960 as 7/1000. The exact percent, to the nearest thousandth of a percent, is actually 0.729%. To estimate the percent of a number, we may convert the percent to a fraction, if useful, to estimate the percent. Example: Estimate 13% of 72. Twice 13% is 26%, which is very close to 25%, and 25%=1/4. We may multiply both sides by 1/2 to get an estimate for 13%: 13% 12.5% = 1/2 &#215; 25% = 1/2 &#215; 1/4 = 1/8. Using our estimate of 1/8 for 13%, 1/8 &#215; 72 = 9, so we get an estimate of 9 for 13% of 72. If we had calculated this exactly, 13% of 72 equals 9.36. It may look like we did a lot more work to get the estimate of 9 that just multiplying 72 by 0.13, but with practice, keeping in mind some simple percents and the fractions they are equal to will enable you to estimate some number combinations very quickly. Example: Estimate 9.6% of 51. Method 1: We could estimate 9.6% of 50. It would be easy to estimate 9.6% of 100, which is just 9.6. Since 50 is half of 100, we can just take half of 9.6, which is 4.8. The actual value of 9.6% of 51 is 4.896, so an estimate of 4.8 is pretty good. Method 2: We could estimate 10% of 51, which is just 5.1. This is not as close an estimate as method 1, but is still a good estimate of the actual answer of 4.896. Interest Interest is a fee paid to borrow money. It is usually charged as a percent of the total amount borrowed. The percent charged is called the interest rate. The amount of money borrowed is called the principal. There are two types of interest, simple interest and compound interest . Example: A bank charges 7% interest on a $ 1000 loan. It will cost the borrower 7% of $ 1000, which is $ 70, for each year the money is borrowed. Note that when the loan is up, the borrower must pay back the original $ 1000. Simple Interest Simple interest is interest figured on the principal only, for the duration of the loan. Figure the interest on the loan for one year, and multiply this amount by the number of years the money is borrowed for. Example: A bank charges 8% simple interest on a $ 600 loan, which is to be paid back in two years. It will cost the borrower 8% of $ 600, which is $ 48, for each year the money is borrowed. Since it is borrowed for two years, the total charge for borrowing the money will be $ 96. After the two years the borrower will still have to pay back the original $ 600. Compound Interest Compound interest is interest figured on the principal and any interest owed from previous years. The interest charged the first year is just the interest rate times the amount of the loan. The interest charged the second year is the interest rate, times the sum of the loan and the interest from the first year. The interest charged the third year is the interest rate, times the sum of the loan and the first two years' interest amounts. Continue figuring the interest in this way for any additional years of the loan. Example: A bank charges 8% compound interest on a $ 600 loan, which is to be paid back in two years. It will cost the borrower 8% of $ 600 the first year, which is $ 48. The second year, it will cost 8% of $ 600 + $ 48 = $ 648, which is $ 51.84. The total amount of interest owed after the two years is $ 48 + $ 51.84 = $ 99.84. Note that this is more than the $ 96 that would be owed if the bank was charging simple interest. Example: A bank charges 4% compound interest on a $ 1000 loan, which is to be paid back in three years. It will cost the borrower 4% of $ 1000 the first year, which is $ 40. The second year, it will cost 4% of $ 1000 + $ 40 = $ 1040, which is $ 41.60. The third year, it will cost 4% of $ 1040 + $ 41.60 = $ 1081.60, which is $ 43.26 (with rounding). The total amount of interest owed after the three years is $ 40 + $ 41.60 + 43.26 = $ 124.86. Percent increase and decrease Percent increase and decrease of a value measure how that value changes, as a percentage of its original value. Example: A collectors' comic book is worth $ 120 in 1994, and in 1995 its value is $ 132. The change is $ 132 - $ 120 = $ 12, an increase in price of $ 12; since $ 12 is 10% of $ 120, we say its value increased by 10% from 1994 to 1995. Example: A bakery makes a chocolate cake that has 8 grams of fat per slice. A new change in the recipe lowers the fat to 6 grams of fat per slice. The change is 8g - 6g = 2g, a decrease of 2 grams; since 2 grams is 25% of 8, we say that the new cake recipe has 25% less fat, or a 25% decrease in fat. Example: Amy is training for the 1500 meter run. When she started training she could run 1500 meters in 5 minutes and 50 seconds. After a year of practice her time decreased by 8%. How fast can she run the race now? Her old time was 5 &#215; 60 + 50 = 350 seconds, and 8% of 350 is 28, so she can run the race in 350 - 28 = 322 seconds (5 minutes and 22 seconds). Example: A fishing magazine sells 110000 copies each month. The company's president wants to increase the sales by 6%. How many extra magazines would they have to sell to reach this goal? This problem is easy, since it only asks for the change in sales: 6% of 110000 equals 6600 more magazines. Percent Discount A discount is a decrease in price, so percent discount is the percent decrease in price. Example: Chocolate bars normally cost 80 cents each, but are on sale for 40 cents each, which is 50% of 80, so the chocolate is on sale at a 50% discount. Example: A compact disc that sells for $ 12 is on sale at a 20% discount. How much does the disc cost on sale? The amount of the discount is 20% of $ 12, which is $ 2.40, so the sale price is $ 12.00 - $ 2.40 = $ 9.60. Example: Movie tickets sell for $ 8.00 each, but if you buy 4 or more you get $ 1.00 off each ticket. What percent discount is this? We figure $ 1 as a percentage of $ 8: $ 1.00/ $ 8.00 &#215; 100% = 12.5%, so this is a 12.5% discount. What is an event? An event is an experiment or collection of experiments. Examples: The following are examples of events. 1) A coin toss. 2) Rolling a die. 3) Rolling 5 dice. 4) Drawing a card from a deck of cards. 5) Drawing 3 cards from a deck. 6) Drawing a marble from a bag of different colored marbles. 7) Spinning a spinner in a board game. 8) Tossing a coin and rolling a die. Possible Outcomes of an Event Possible outcomes of an event are the results which may occur from any event. (Remember, they may not occur.) Examples: The following are possible outcomes of events. 1) A coin toss has two possible outcomes. The outcomes are &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot;. 2) Rolling a regular six-sided die has six possible outcomes. You may get a side with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 dots. 3) Drawing a card from a regular deck of 52 playing cards has 52 possible outcomes. Each of the 52 playing cards is different, so there are 52 possible outcomes for drawing a card. 4) How many different outcomes are there for the color of marble that may be drawn from a bag containing 3 red, 4 green, and 5 blue marbles? This event has 3 possible outcomes. You may get a red marble, a green marble, or a blue marble. Even if the marbles are different sizes, the outcome we are considering is the color of the marble that is drawn. 5) How many different outcomes are there for the colors of two marbles that may be drawn from a bag containing 3 red, 4 green, and 5 blue marble? This event has 6 possible outcomes: you may get two reds, two greens, two blues, a red and blue, a red and green, or a blue and green. 6) Rolling two regular dice, one of them red and one of them blue, has 36 possible outcomes. The outcomes are listed in the table below. Red Die Result: Red1 Red2 Red3 Red4 Red5 Red6 Blue1 Blue1, Red1 Blue1, Red2 Blue1, Red3 Blue1, Red4 Blue1, Red5 Blue1, Red6 Blue2 Blue2, Red1 Blue2, Red2 Blue2, Red3 Blue2, Red4 Blue2, Red5 Blue2, Red6 Blue Die Blue3 Blue3, Red1 Blue3, Red2 Blue3, Red3 Blue3, Red4 Blue3, Red5 Blue3, Red6 Blue4 Blue4, Red1 Blue4, Red2 Blue4, Red3 Blue4, Red4 Blue4, Red5 Blue4, Red6 Blue5 Blue5, Red1 Blue5, Red2 Blue5, Red3 Blue5, Red4 Blue5, Red5 Blue5, Red6 Blue6 Blue6, Red1 Blue6, Red2 Blue6, Red3 Blue6, Red4 Blue6, Red5 Blue6, Red6 Note that the event tells us how to think of the outcomes. Even though there are 12 different marbles in example 4, the event tells us to count only the color of the die, so there are three outcomes. In example 6, the two dice are different, and there are 36 possible outcomes. Suppose we don't care about the color of the dice in example 6. Then we would only see 21 different outcomes: 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6, 3-3, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, 4-4, 4-5, 4-6, 5-5, 5-6, and 6-6. (We think of a 1 and a 2, a 1-2, as being the same as a 2 and a 1.) Probability of an Outcome The probability of an outcome for a particular event is a number telling us how likely a particular outcome is to occur. This number is the ratio of the number of ways the outcome may occur to the number of total possible outcomes for the event. Probability is usually expressed as a fraction or decimal. Since the number of ways a certain outcome may occur is always smaller or equal to the total number of outcomes, the probability of an event is some number from 0 through 1. Example: Suppose there are 10 balls in a bucket numbered as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, and 6. A single ball is randomly chosen from the bucket. What is the probability of drawing a ball numbered 1? There are 2 ways to draw a 1, since there are two balls numbered 1. The total possible number of outcomes is 10, since there are 10 balls. The probability of drawing a 1 is the ratio 2/10 = 1/5. Example: Suppose there are 10 balls in a bucket numbered as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, and 6. A single ball is randomly chosen from the bucket. What is the probability of drawing a ball with a number greater than 4? There are 3 ways this may happen, since 3 of the balls are numbered greater than 4. The total possible number of outcomes is 10, since there are 10 balls. The probability of drawing a number greater than 4 is the ratio 3/10. Since this ratio is larger than the one in the previous example, we say that this event has a greater chance of occurring than drawing a 1. Example: Suppose there are 10 balls in a bucket numbered as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, and 6. A single ball is randomly chosen from the bucket. What is the probability of drawing a ball with a number greater than 6? Since none of the balls are numbered greater than 6, this can occur in 0 ways. The total possible number of outcomes is 10, since there are 10 balls. The probability of drawing a number greater than 6 is the ratio 0/10 = 0. Example: Suppose there are 10 balls in a bucket numbered as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, and 6. A single ball is randomly chosen from the bucket. What is the probability of drawing a ball with a number less than 7? Since all of the balls are numbered greater than 7, this can occur in 10 ways. The total possible number of outcomes is 10, since there are 10 balls. The probability of drawing a number less than 7 is the ratio 10/10 = 1. Note in the last two examples that a probability of 0 meant that the event would not occur, and a probability of 1 meant the event definitely would occur. Example: Suppose a card is drawn at random from a regular deck of 52 cards. What is the probability that the card is an ace? There are 4 different ways that the card can be an ace, since 4 of the 52 cards are aces. There are 52 different total outcomes, one for each card in the deck. The probability of drawing an ace is the ratio 4/52 = 1/13. Example: Suppose a regular die is rolled. What is the probability of getting a 3 or a 6? There are a total of 6 possible outcomes. Rolling a 3 or a 6 are two of them, so the probability is the ratio of 2/6 = 1/3.

<h3><a name="whatisapercent">What is a Percent?</a></h3>
<p> A percent is a ratio of a number to 100. A percent can be expressed using the 
  percent symbol %. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 10 percent or 10% are both the same, and stand 
  for the ratio 10:100. 
<p> <img src="percent.GIF"> 
<hr>
<h3><a name="percentasafraction">Percent as a fraction</a></h3>
<p> A percent is equivalent to a fraction with denominator 100. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 5% of something = 5/100 of that thing. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 2 1/2% is equal to what fraction? <br>
  Answer:<br>
  2 1/2%&nbsp;=&nbsp;(2 1/2)/100&nbsp;=&nbsp;5/200&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/40 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 52% most nearly equals which one of 1/2, 1/4, 
  2, 8, or 1/5?<br>
  Answer: 52%&nbsp;=&nbsp;52/100. This is very close to 50/100, or 1/2. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 13/25 is what %?<br>
  We want to convert 13/25 to a fraction with 100 in the denominator: 13/25&nbsp;=&nbsp;(13&nbsp;&#215;&nbsp;4)/(25&nbsp;&#215;&nbsp;4)&nbsp;=&nbsp;52/100, 
  so 13/25&nbsp;=&nbsp;52%. <br>
  Alternatively, we could say: Let 13/25 be <i>n</i>%, and let us find <i>n</i>. Then 
  13/25&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>n</i>/100, so cross multiplying, 13&nbsp;&#215;&nbsp;100&nbsp;=&nbsp;25&nbsp;&#215;&nbsp;<i>n</i>, 
  so 25<i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;13&nbsp;&#215;&nbsp;100&nbsp;=&nbsp;1300. Then 25<i>n</i>&nbsp;&#247&nbsp;25&nbsp;=&nbsp;1300&nbsp;&#247&nbsp;25, 
  so <i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1300&nbsp;&#247&nbsp;25&nbsp;=&nbsp;52. So 13/25&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>n</i>%&nbsp;=&nbsp;52%. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 8/200 is what %?<br>
  Method 1: 8/200&nbsp;=&nbsp;(4&nbsp;&#215;&nbsp;2)/(100&nbsp;&#215;&nbsp;2), so 
  8/200&nbsp;=&nbsp;4/100&nbsp;=&nbsp;4%.<br>
  Method 2: Let 8/200 be n%. Then 8/200&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>n</i>/100, so 200&nbsp;&#215;&nbsp;<i>n</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;800, 
  and 200<i>n</i>&nbsp;&#247&nbsp;200&nbsp;=&nbsp;800&nbsp;&#247&nbsp;200&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, 
  so <i>n</i>%&nbsp;=&nbsp;4%. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> Write 80% as a fraction in lowest terms.<br>
  80%&nbsp;=&nbsp;80/100, which is equal to 4/5 in lowest terms. 
<hr>
<h3><a name="percentasadecimal">Percent as a decimal</a></h3>
<p> Percent and hundredths are basically equivalent. This makes conversion between 
  percent and decimals very easy. 
<p> To convert from a decimal to a percent, just move the decimal 2 places to the 
  right. For example, 0.15 = 15 hundredths = 15%. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 
<p> 0.0006 = 0.06% 
<p> Converting from percent to decimal form is similar, only you move the decimal 
  point 2 places to the left. You must also be sure, before doing this, that the percentage 
  itself is expressed in decimal form, without fractions.<br>
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 
<p> Express 3% in decimal form. Moving the decimal 2 to the left (and adding in 0's 
  to the left of the 3 as place holders,) we get 0.03. <br>
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 
<p> Express 97 1/4% in decimal form. First we write 97 1/4 in decimal form: 97.25. 
  Then we move the decimal 2 places to the left to get 0.9725, so 97 1/4%&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.9725. 
  This makes sense, since 97 1/4% is nearly 100%, and 0.9725 is nearly 1. 
<hr>
<h3><a name="estimatingpercents">Estimating percents</a></h3>
<p> When estimating percents, it is helpful to remember the fractional equivalent 
  of some simple percents. 
<p> 100%&nbsp;=&nbsp;1<br>
  (100% of any number equals that number.) 
<p> 50%&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/2&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5<br>
  (50% of any number equals half of that number.) 
<p> 25%&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/4&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.25<br>
  (25% of any number equals one-fourth of that number.) 
<p> 10%&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/10&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.1<br>
  (10% of any number equals one-tenth of that number.) 
<p> 1%&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/100&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.01<br>
  (1% of any number equals one-hundredth of that number.) 
<p> Because it is very easy to switch between a decimal and a percent, estimating 
  a percent is as easy as estimating a fraction as a decimal, and converting to a 
  percent by multiplying by 100. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 
<p> Estimate 19 as a percent of 80.<br>
  As a fraction, 19/80&nbsp;<img src="approx.gif" align="ABSMIDDLE">&nbsp;20/80&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/4&nbsp;=0.25&nbsp;=&nbsp;25%. 
  The step used to estimate the percent occurred when we estimated 19/80 as 20/80. 
  <br>
  The exact percent is actually 23.75%, so the estimate of 25% is only 1.25% off. 
  (About 1 part in 100.) 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 
<p> Estimate 7 as a percent of 960.<br>
  As a fraction, 7/960&nbsp;<img src="approx.gif" align="ABSMIDDLE">&nbsp;7/100&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.007&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.7%. 
  The step used to estimate the percent occurred when we estimated 7/960 as 7/1000. 
  <br>
  The exact percent, to the nearest thousandth of a percent, is actually 0.729%.<br>
  To estimate the percent of a number, we may convert the percent to a fraction, if 
  useful, to estimate the percent. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 
<p> Estimate 13% of 72.<br>
  Twice 13% is 26%, which is very close to 25%, and 25%=1/4. We may multiply both 
  sides by 1/2 to get an estimate for 13%: 13%&nbsp;<img src="approx.gif" align="ABSMIDDLE">&nbsp;12.5%&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/2&nbsp;&#215;&nbsp;25%&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/2&nbsp;&#215;&nbsp;1/4&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/8. 
  Using our estimate of 1/8 for 13%, 1/8&nbsp;&#215;&nbsp;72&nbsp;=&nbsp;9, so we 
  get an estimate of 9 for 13% of 72. <br>
  If we had calculated this exactly, 13% of 72 equals 9.36. It may look like we did 
  a lot more work to get the estimate of 9 that just multiplying 72 by 0.13, but with 
  practice, keeping in mind some simple percents and the fractions they are equal 
  to will enable you to estimate some number combinations very quickly. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 
<p> Estimate 9.6% of 51.<br>
  Method 1: We could estimate 9.6% of 50. It would be easy to estimate 9.6% of 100, 
  which is just 9.6. Since 50 is half of 100, we can just take half of 9.6, which 
  is 4.8. The actual value of 9.6% of 51 is 4.896, so an estimate of 4.8 is pretty 
  good. 
<p> Method 2: We could estimate 10% of 51, which is just 5.1. This is not as close 
  an estimate as method 1, but is still a good estimate of the actual answer of 4.896.

<h3><a name="interest">Interest</a></h3>
<p> Interest is a fee paid to borrow money. It is usually charged as a percent of 
  the total amount borrowed. The percent charged is called the interest rate. The 
  amount of money borrowed is called the principal. There are two types of interest, 
  <a href="percent.htm#simpleinterest">simple interest</a> and <a href="percent.htm#compoundinterest">compound 
  interest</a>. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> A bank charges 7% interest on a $1000 loan. 
  It will cost the borrower 7% of $1000, which is $70, for each year the money is 
  borrowed. Note that when the loan is up, the borrower must pay back the original 
  $1000. 
<hr>
<h3><a name="simpleinterest">Simple Interest</a></h3>
<p> Simple interest is interest figured on the principal only, for the duration of 
  the loan. Figure the interest on the loan for one year, and multiply this amount 
  by the number of years the money is borrowed for.<br>
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> A bank charges 8% simple interest on a $600 
  loan, which is to be paid back in two years. It will cost the borrower 8% of $600, 
  which is $48, for each year the money is borrowed. Since it is borrowed for two 
  years, the total charge for borrowing the money will be $96. After the two years 
  the borrower will still have to pay back the original $600. 
<hr>
<h3><a name="compoundinterest">Compound Interest</a></h3>
<p> Compound interest is interest figured on the principal and any interest owed from 
  previous years. The interest charged the first year is just the interest rate times 
  the amount of the loan. The interest charged the second year is the interest rate, 
  times the sum of the loan and the interest from the first year. The interest charged 
  the third year is the interest rate, times the sum of the loan and the first two 
  years' interest amounts. Continue figuring the interest in this way for any additional 
  years of the loan. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> A bank charges 8% compound interest on a $600 
  loan, which is to be paid back in two years. It will cost the borrower 8% of $600 
  the first year, which is $48. The second year, it will cost 8% of $600&nbsp;+&nbsp;$48&nbsp;=&nbsp;$648, 
  which is $51.84. The total amount of interest owed after the two years is $48&nbsp;+&nbsp;$51.84&nbsp;=&nbsp;$99.84. 
  Note that this is more than the $96 that would be owed if the bank was charging 
  simple interest. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> A bank charges 4% compound interest on a $1000 
  loan, which is to be paid back in three years. It will cost the borrower 4% of $1000 
  the first year, which is $40. The second year, it will cost 4% of $1000&nbsp;+&nbsp;$40&nbsp;=&nbsp;$1040, 
  which is $41.60. The third year, it will cost 4% of $1040&nbsp;+&nbsp;$41.60&nbsp;=&nbsp;$1081.60, 
  which is $43.26 (with rounding). The total amount of interest owed after the three 
  years is $40&nbsp;+&nbsp;$41.60&nbsp;+&nbsp;43.26&nbsp;=&nbsp;$124.86.

<h3><a name="percentincreaseanddecrease">Percent increase and decrease</a></h3>
<p> Percent increase and decrease of a value measure how that value changes, as a 
  percentage of its original value. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> A collectors' comic book is worth $120 in 
  1994, and in 1995 its value is $132. The change is $132&nbsp;-&nbsp;$120&nbsp;=&nbsp;$12, 
  an increase in price of $12; since $12 is 10% of $120, we say its value increased 
  by 10% from 1994 to 1995. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> A bakery makes a chocolate cake that has 8 
  grams of fat per slice. A new change in the recipe lowers the fat to 6 grams of 
  fat per slice. The change is 8g&nbsp;-&nbsp;6g&nbsp;=&nbsp;2g, a decrease of 2 grams; 
  since 2 grams is 25% of 8, we say that the new cake recipe has 25% less fat, or 
  a 25% decrease in fat. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> Amy is training for the 1500 meter run. When 
  she started training she could run 1500 meters in 5 minutes and 50 seconds. After 
  a year of practice her time decreased by 8%. How fast can she run the race now? 
  Her old time was 5&nbsp;&#215;&nbsp;60&nbsp;+ 50&nbsp;=&nbsp;350 seconds, and 8% 
  of 350 is 28, so she can run the race in 350&nbsp;-&nbsp;28&nbsp;=&nbsp;322 seconds 
  (5 minutes and 22 seconds). 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> A fishing magazine sells 110000 copies each 
  month. The company's president wants to increase the sales by 6%. How many extra 
  magazines would they have to sell to reach this goal? This problem is easy, since 
  it only asks for the change in sales: 6% of 110000 equals 6600 more magazines. 
<hr>
<h3><a name="percentdiscount">Percent Discount</a></h3>
<p> A discount is a decrease in price, so percent discount is the percent decrease 
  in price.<br>
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> Chocolate bars normally cost 80 cents each, 
  but are on sale for 40 cents each, which is 50% of 80, so the chocolate is on sale 
  at a 50% discount. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> A compact disc that sells for $12 is on sale 
  at a 20% discount. How much does the disc cost on sale? The amount of the discount 
  is 20% of $12, which is $2.40, so the sale price is $12.00&nbsp;-&nbsp;$2.40&nbsp;=&nbsp;$9.60. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> Movie tickets sell for $8.00 each, but if 
  you buy 4 or more you get $1.00 off each ticket. What percent discount is this? 
  We figure $1 as a percentage of $8: $1.00/$8.00&nbsp;&#215;&nbsp;100%&nbsp;=&nbsp;12.5%, 
  so this is a 12.5% discount. 
<hr>
<h3><a name="whatisanevent">What is an event?</a></h3>
<p> An event is an experiment or collection of experiments. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Examples:</font> 
<p> The following are examples of events. 
<p> 1) A coin toss.<br>
  2) Rolling a die.<br>
  3) Rolling 5 dice.<br>
  4) Drawing a card from a deck of cards.<br>
  5) Drawing 3 cards from a deck.<br>
  6) Drawing a marble from a bag of different colored marbles.<br>
  7) Spinning a spinner in a board game.<br>
  8) Tossing a coin and rolling a die. 
<hr>
<h3><a name="possibleoutcomesofanevent">Possible Outcomes of an Event</a></h3>
<p> Possible outcomes of an event are the results which may occur from any event. 
  (Remember, they may not occur.) 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Examples:</font> 
<p> The following are possible outcomes of events. 
<p> 1) A coin toss has two possible outcomes. The outcomes are &quot;heads&quot; and 
  &quot;tails&quot;.<br>
  2) Rolling a regular six-sided die has six possible outcomes. You may get a side 
  with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 dots.<br>
  3) Drawing a card from a regular deck of 52 playing cards has 52 possible outcomes. 
  Each of the 52 playing cards is different, so there are 52 possible outcomes for 
  drawing a card.<br>
  4) How many different outcomes are there for the color of marble that may be drawn 
  from a bag containing 3 red, 4 green, and 5 blue marbles? This event has 3 possible 
  outcomes. You may get a red marble, a green marble, or a blue marble. Even if the 
  marbles are different sizes, the outcome we are considering is the <i>color</i> 
  of the marble that is drawn. <br>
  5) How many different outcomes are there for the colors of two marbles that may 
  be drawn from a bag containing 3 red, 4 green, and 5 blue marble? This event has 
  6 possible outcomes: you may get two reds, two greens, two blues, a red and blue, 
  a red and green, or a blue and green.<br>
  6) Rolling two regular dice, one of them red and one of them blue, has 36 possible 
  outcomes. The outcomes are listed in the table below.

<p> Note that the event tells us how to think of the outcomes. Even though there are 
  12 different marbles in example 4, the event tells us to count only the color of 
  the die, so there are three outcomes. In example 6, the two dice are different, 
  and there are 36 possible outcomes. Suppose we don't care about the color of the 
  dice in example 6. Then we would only see 21 different outcomes: 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 
  1-4, 1-5, 1-6, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6, 3-3, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, 4-4, 4-5, 4-6, 5-5, 
  5-6, and 6-6. (We think of a 1 and a 2, a 1-2, as being the same as a 2 and a 1.) 
<hr>
<h3><a name="probability">Probability of an Outcome</a></h3>
<p> The probability of an outcome for a particular event is a number telling us how 
  likely a particular outcome is to occur. This number is the ratio of the number 
  of ways the outcome may occur to the number of total possible outcomes for the event. 
  Probability is usually expressed as a fraction or decimal. Since the number of ways 
  a certain outcome may occur is always smaller or equal to the total number of outcomes, 
  the probability of an event is some number from 0 through 1. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 
<p> Suppose there are 10 balls in a bucket numbered as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 
  4, 5, 6, and 6. A single ball is randomly chosen from the bucket. What is the probability 
  of drawing a ball numbered 1? There are 2 ways to draw a 1, since there are two 
  balls numbered 1. The total possible number of outcomes is 10, since there are 10 
  balls. 
<p> The probability of drawing a 1 is the ratio 2/10&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/5. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 
<p> Suppose there are 10 balls in a bucket numbered as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 
  4, 5, 6, and 6. A single ball is randomly chosen from the bucket. What is the probability 
  of drawing a ball with a number greater than 4? There are 3 ways this may happen, 
  since 3 of the balls are numbered greater than 4. The total possible number of outcomes 
  is 10, since there are 10 balls. The probability of drawing a number greater than 
  4 is the ratio 3/10. Since this ratio is larger than the one in the previous example, 
  we say that this event has a greater chance of occurring than drawing a 1. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 
<p> Suppose there are 10 balls in a bucket numbered as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 
  4, 5, 6, and 6. A single ball is randomly chosen from the bucket. What is the probability 
  of drawing a ball with a number greater than 6? Since none of the balls are numbered 
  greater than 6, this can occur in 0 ways. The total possible number of outcomes 
  is 10, since there are 10 balls. The probability of drawing a number greater than 
  6 is the ratio 0/10&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 
<p> Suppose there are 10 balls in a bucket numbered as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 
  4, 5, 6, and 6. A single ball is randomly chosen from the bucket. What is the probability 
  of drawing a ball with a number less than 7? Since all of the balls are numbered 
  greater than 7, this can occur in 10 ways. The total possible number of outcomes 
  is 10, since there are 10 balls. The probability of drawing a number less than 7 
  is the ratio 10/10&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.<br>
  Note in the last two examples that a probability of 0 meant that the event would 
  not occur, and a probability of 1 meant the event definitely would occur. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 
<p> Suppose a card is drawn at random from a regular deck of 52 cards. What is the 
  probability that the card is an ace? There are 4 different ways that the card can 
  be an ace, since 4 of the 52 cards are aces. There are 52 different total outcomes, 
  one for each card in the deck. The probability of drawing an ace is the ratio 4/52&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/13. 
<p> <font color=#0000FF>Example:</font> 
<p> Suppose a regular die is rolled. What is the probability of getting a 3 or a 6? 
  There are a total of 6 possible outcomes. Rolling a 3 or a 6 are two of them, so 
  the probability is the ratio of 2/6&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/3.
