[see dialect ] the grammatical case with expresses the destination of the ation signified by a verb. A spelling scheme promoted by the American Literacy Council . Fonetic is derived from WES and related to New Spelling . Electronic text can be easily converted to fonetic using the BTRSPL converter which is available on the web. There are more than 10,000 digitized books on the web and any one of them can be quickly converted to ALC's American Spelling using the converter. (See Rondthaller &amp; Lias. 1986. The Dictionary of Simplified American Spelling) A variation in pronunciation that is still close enough to be interpreted as an instance of a particular phoneme. An insignificant variation. A difference in pronunciation such as the sound of L in "look" and "little" which is ignored by language users. An ordered set of symbols used as sound signs. The alphabet was invented only once and was spread by the Phoenician traders and others throughout the world. The Semites were inspired by the Egyptian writing system (esp. middle Egyptian , 1200 bc) which made limited use of sound signs (phonograms) mostly for proper names. Egyptian sound signs were not ordered. The standardizing the arrangement of 22 semitic symbols allowed it to be used as a number system. The alphabet doubled as a number system for the Phoenicians and the Greeks - the 8th letter in classical Greek, eta (eituh), is associated with eight (eit) and H (eich), originally a squared off 8. The 26 letters which form the basis of the alphabet used for most Western European languages. Late arrivals include j, k, u, and w. J used to be an alternate i and y was a slighty different sound. v and u were used for the same sound until the 16th century. The distinction between f and v also occured at this time. The Roman letters were adopted for English in the 8th century. By the 10th century, English had a consistent augmented Latin alphabet. 25% of the consistency was lost after the conquest of the Norman French. Another 30% was lost with the great vowel shift in the 15th century. Modern spelling dates from about 1755. By this time only 40% of the writing system was consistent with the alphabet. A writing system is alphabetic when the graphemes (shapes or letters) refer to specific phonemes (sounds). The traditional English writing system, which was standardized at the word level around 1755, is about 40% alphabetic, 10% morphemic, and 50% chaotic. See syllabary and logogram . English (circa 1000 AD) was once about 90% alphabetic and on par with other roman based writing systems that have undergone several reforms to keep spelling aligned with pronunciation. In unreformed writing systems, words are often spelled as they were pronounced a 1000 years ago. Greek, English, and Icelandic are examples. have= hah -vuh alphabetic order alternation altscript anglic ASCII (Am Std. Code) A traditional order or arrangement of symbols (letters) once used as a numbering system by the Semites and Greeks. This conventional order has changed very little over the past 3,000 years. Substitution of one letter for another, e.g. i for y A spelling scheme using positional spelling by John Reilly [hyly] for /haili/ is an example. See also snapscript and OGD. A variation of New Spelling published by Zachrissen (ca. 1950) The standard character set used in computer text files and email containing 26 lower case and 26 upper case letters without diacritics. ASCII also contains punctuation marks and numerals. (See Latin 1 for any special characters used in other orthographies) BTR SPL Broad romic Broad transcription A program that converts text from TO to reformed orthography. The name, betrspl , is an abbreviation for better spelling. Alan Mole is the principle author of BTRSPL. An IPA based phonemic notational system that uses the roman character set plus a few special characters (such as the turned e, c, and a or digraphs) to represent 41 to 46 phonemes. Sweet's broad romic used traditional continental sound values. Such a transcription is not quite precise enough to fully distinguish dialects (see diaphonic ) A phonetic transcription of a particular dialect is a narrow transcription. A broad transcription would tend to ignore regional pronunciation differences. (see phonemic ) category character character set Checked Vowel Checked Clipped Spelling Chekt Klipt Speling CKS cognate consonant corpus creole cut speling A range of instances treated as equivalent for some purpose. A phoneme is a category - different sounds that are treated as equivalent by a language community. A grapheme is a category. Categories are abstractions. One can only see or hear instances. You cannot hear a phoneme. A letter or digit or symbol A collection of letters and symbols - usually restricted A vowel that is always followed by a consonant and is therefore short. When a free vowel comes before a consonant, its duration is about as short as a checked (short) vowel (eg, mad, made). In TO, checked vowels are often marked with a double consonant. (madden) A space efficient IPA based spelling scheme by Steve Bett. CKS is an attempt to build an ASCII pronunciation guide for English which can be read by anyone versed in TO.

New Guinea tok pidgin English is the best known example. An unsystematic or non-phonemic spelling scheme by Chris Upward which fixes 75% of the problems with English spelling by removing silent, redundant, and superfluous letters. Word patterns are largely undisturbed. See Valerie Yule's surplus cut spelling diacritic diaphone diaphonic dictionary (lexicon) digraph diphthong dyslexia dyslexic An accent mark indicating a change in a letter's sound value or stress An effective way to deal with the shortage of sound signs in ASCII . Latin 1 options include diresis, ring, grave, and acute markers. a mark added to a letter or symbolindicating a change in its usual pronunciation. e.g. e e e all the different forms of a phoneme that collectively occur in all the dialects of a lnaguage. A broad (as opposed to a narrow) transcription of sounds An alphabetical list of words and meanings. TO dictionaries also include a pronunciation guide which is absent in dictionaries in most other languages Two letter combinaions representing one sound, e.g. sh, ph (phone), ee A blend of two vowel phonemes. e.g. oi (see glide) Profound difficulty in acquisition of literacy A person with dyslexia elide, elision etymological etymology extended vowel Fanetik font free vowel The omission of a spoken vowel or syllable Referring to the origin of words The study of the origin of words A long vowel sound, e.g. ee, aa or oo. Often includes diphthongs. A phonemic spelling scheme A typeface in a particular size and weight - e.g. Arial 8 pt. italic A vowel that can occur at the end of a word. (Cf. checked vowel) grapheme glottal glottal stop [ipa ?] glottis A category that may include several different shapes but referencing but one phoneme (e.g., G, g, g ) One of several shapes understood as being equivalent in terms of reference.

(gram) 2. A change in voice pitch (phonetics) . a linguistic form that is an exception to a pattern or stated rule Initial Teaching Alphabet International Phonetic Alphabet ( IPA , IFA) Interspel IPA ITA A system devised to help children to read (paedography). Pitman's augmented roman alphabet used as an initial teaching medium. (see ITA) A notational scheme developed in 1890's by Passy and Jones for use by linguists as a standard means of graphically representing spoken languages. IPA uses the roman alphabet as a starting point and augments it as needed with rotated characters and special symbols. IPA can be used for a broad or narrow transcription of a language. A pragmatic spelling scheme by Valerie Yule International Phonetic Alphabet Initial Teaching Alphabet, a system devised by Sir James Pitman. It was heavily used in the schools in the late 1960's particularly in the UK. ITA is based on New Spelling and uses a special font to augment the roman character set. ITA uses 40+ graphemes.

The ability to read and comprehend a newspaper is considered the threshold of literacy. The usual or conventional meaning of a word. cf. figurative A word mark or word sign. Can be comprehended without a particular phonographic rendering. 4 is a logogram. The phonetic interpretation of a logogram will be different in different languages. 4-SALE would be read as "quatro sahleh" in Spanish. (see numbers as sound signs ) Chinese is often referred to as a logographic writing system. Chinese ideograms usually refer to words or concepts although they often contain some phonographic clues. [ref: deFrancis, Visible Language ] Lojicon -logical consonants Lojikon long vowel A spelling scheme based on consistent use of consonants Logical Icons - A pictographic script Since northern European languages usually have 12 pure vowels and use a character set containing only 5 vowel letters, the same letter is used to denote at least two vowel sounds: a long and short sound. Linguists refer to the long vowels as a:, e: i: o: and u:.

Most markers are next to the vowel they modify [mo a t]. The letter e after a consonant, or consonants, which lengthens a preceding vowel. A meaningful unit of a language that cannot be further divided. English morphemes include s (for plural) /dogz/ &amp; /cats/ and [ed] for past tense /started, finisht/. Consistent morphemic spelling often misrepresents pronunciation as in checked/chekt Referring to a morpheme NES New Spelling notation Nu Folik New Follick (1934) Nue Speling New Spelling (ca. 1910) New English Spelling - refers to an update of New Spelling A simple consistent close-to-TO spelling scheme (see below) The representation of sounds by symbols. A means of transcribing spoken language into visual symbols. A variation on the spelling scheme developed by Mont Follick, MP. What English might look like if written in Spanish or Portuguese orthography. See also Spanglish . The spelling scheme, suggested by Ellis, that is the foundation for most phonemic spelling notations based on the principle of least disturbance (of traditional English spelling conventions) Extended vowels are written AE[ei] EE[i:] IE [ai] OE[ou] UE[ju] (NS[ipa]) orthographic orthography From The Devil's Dictionary by Ambrose Bierce Literally "right markings" or "right writng" The study or practice of correct spelling or writing. Can include the study of various rules and regularities and some grammar. That part of grammar that treats of the way a given language is written. The orthography is distinct from spoken language. English can be written in the orthography designed for Spanish. The problem with hitchhiking orthographies is mostly a problem of having sounds without associated symbols.

The smallest contrastive unit of sound that distinguishes one word (meaning) from another. The extent to which spelling is a guide to pronunciation. TO has a low level of phonemicity compared to the Spanish orthographic system When the spelling of a word corresponds to its pronunciation A narrow detailed transcription that can distinguish regional accents A broad transcription that preserves only those distinctions that have semantic value for native languge users. Teaching reading by first introducing letter sounds (see whole word) A sound sign. e.g., a letter or word representing a sound. In an alphabetical system the phonograms represent letters. In a syllabary, the sound signs represent syllables. see hotsuma . The form of a word denoting more than one in number Many meanings, e.g. words such as fair, bar Many sound values. English (TO) contains letters associated with 14 different sounds. When the sound value of letters varies according to position in a word. See John Reilly on positional spelling. A guide often given in English dictionaries to show the sound of words. Most spelling reformers want to use a consistent spelling guide as for the writing system instead of TO. An SSS publication relating to a notational scheme or spelling reform proposal. The scheme is not necessarily endorsed by the society. It represents an individual's views.

Semite, Semitic spanglish speech recognition spell checker spelling SR-1 SS SSS stress surplus cut syllabic syllable symbol symbol-sound correspondence synonym A linguistic, not a racial, classification. The languages spoken in the Middle East since ancient times. Ancient Egyptian was a blend of west african (Hamitic) and Semitic. The early writing systems for these languages did not contain letters for vowels. chart Spanglish is a systematic and highly phonemic way of transcribing English speech. It is based on the ancient Saxon alphabet [900-1066] and the old practice of inserting trailing double consonants to mark short stressed vowels. The augmented Latin alphabet [sound-symbol correspondences] was used until the 15th c. when the pronunciaiton of the long vowels in many words changed. There was no corresponding change in spelling. This led to a divergence between spelling and pronunciation. There are two ways to represent each vowel in Spanglish: stressed or unstressed. Most one syllable words therefor have two possible spellings. e.g. aet or att, ej and edj. Spanglish is a parallel pronunciation guide spelling. Respelling is limited to words that cannot be understood when pronounced according to the values assigned in the Saxon alphabet. enough becomes enuff or enof. A computer program that checks spelling.

WES World English Spelling whole word method word sign ( logogram ) A spelling scheme A way of teaching reading without reference to letter sounds See also look say method An irregular spelling such as the, me, to, of which is retained in a reformed spelling scheme. A symbol without a consistent sound association. In TO, the words [ the, of, and a ] are considered word signs due to their irregularity. They are often retained in otherwise phonemic and consistent notational systems such as anglic . Phonics Phonics does more than teach reading by the `sound of a word': it is a method of teaching reading and spelling by teaching all sound-symbol correspondences, from simple to complex, systematically and directly. It is important to insist that phonics relates sounds to written symbols - it needs to be distinguished from the current bandwagon of training in `phonemic awareness' BEFORE teaching letters. sitemap-linguistics The sitemap provides links to pages with detailed disucssions of many many of these terms This site of the Spelling Reform Ring is owned by steve bett [ Previo us 5 Sites | Previou s | Next | Next 5 Sites | | Random Site | List Sites ] To add to, comment on, or critique an entry in this glossary, contact Steve Bett This site of the Saundspel Ring is owned by steve bett [ Previo us 5 Sites | Previou s | Next | Next 5 Sites | | Random Site | List Sites ] COMMENTS I developed a more technical glossary of linguistics several years ago that few people ever used. The problem with narrow technical definitions such as "allophone --two more more forms of the same phoneme" is that they are clear only to those who already have the concept. Damian came up with a much better selection of terms and supplied his own down to earth definitions. His emailed glossary was the foundation for the current glossary. Since I added to, edited, and changed half of the entries that Damian supplied, I take responsibility for the errors. If you have something good to say about this list, directo those comments to Damian. -- Steve Bett sbett@mailcity.com I inadvertently failed to copy the names of the people who supplied these comments on the SSS Forum: -SB .............. I think allophone - An alternative, similar sound for the same spelling pattern - is wrong: it's nothing to do with spelling so not: "allophone An alternative, similar sound for the same spelling pattern" it's nearer to "a variation in the way in which a particular sound is pronounced, which carries no function in terms of distinguishing it from other sounds; for example 'l' in 'look' and 'little'". The Chambers dictionary definition is not really suitable for general discussion ("one of two or more forms of the same phoneme") ............... I'm not sure that a "free vowel" is always the same as a "long vowel"; it's more to do with syllable boundaries than length. In some languages it could well be the same thing, but I don't think it's automatic. ............... "inflection" need not be at the end of a word. Welsh for example changes the sound at the beginning of a word. ............... "ligature" I'd add "... to make a single character" .............. "logogram" could include as a more immediate example the ampersand "&amp;" and all the numerals. .............. "Roman alphabet" - a possibly dodgy definition, since only English uses this set of 26! A more roundabout definition (ie one less vulnerable to pedants) might be "The 26 letters which form the basis of the alphabet used for Western European languages"? ............. perhaps you could add: "glide" - a sound that appears between two others as a side effect of the pronunciation, for example "lawR and order" (This is an important phenomenon that figures prominently in Taam's spellings, so could be worth including) See Truespel From John Reilly's website.

<p><font size=-1>A variation in pronunciation that is still close enough
to be interpreted as an instance of a particular phoneme.&nbsp; An insignificant
variation.&nbsp; A difference in pronunciation such as the sound of <b>L</b>
in "look" and "little" which is ignored by language users.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font size=-1>An ordered set of symbols used as sound signs. The alphabet
was invented only once and was spread by the Phoenician traders and others
throughout the world. The Semites were inspired by the Egyptian writing
system (esp. middle <a href="alphabet.htm">Egyptian</a>, 1200 bc)&nbsp;
which made limited use of&nbsp; sound signs (phonograms) mostly for proper
names. Egyptian sound signs were not ordered.&nbsp; The standardizing the
arrangement of 22 semitic symbols allowed it to be used as a number system.
The alphabet doubled as a number system for the Phoenicians and the Greeks
- the 8th letter in classical Greek,&nbsp; eta (eituh), is associated with
eight (eit) and H (eich), originally a squared off 8.</font>
<p><font size=-1>The 26 letters which form the basis of the alphabet used
for most Western European languages. Late arrivals include&nbsp; j, k,
u, and w.&nbsp; J used to be an alternate i and y was a slighty different
sound.&nbsp; v and u were used for the same sound until the 16th century.&nbsp;
The distinction between f and v also occured at this time.</font>
<p><font size=-1>The Roman letters were adopted for English in the 8th
century.&nbsp; By the 10th century, English had a consistent augmented
Latin alphabet. 25% of the consistency was lost after the conquest of the
Norman French.&nbsp; Another 30% was lost with the great vowel shift in
the 15th century. Modern spelling dates from about 1755.&nbsp; By this
time only 40% of the writing system was consistent with the alphabet.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font size=-1>A writing system is alphabetic when the graphemes (shapes
or letters) refer to specific phonemes (sounds).&nbsp; The traditional
English writing system, which was standardized at the word level around
1755, is about 40% alphabetic, 10% morphemic, and 50% chaotic.&nbsp; See
<a href="#s">syllabary</a>
and <a href="#L">logogram</a>.&nbsp; English (circa 1000 AD) was once about
90% alphabetic and on par with other roman based writing systems that have
undergone several reforms to keep spelling aligned with pronunciation.
In unreformed writing systems, words are often spelled as they were pronounced
a 1000 years ago.&nbsp; Greek, English, and Icelandic are examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

is a systematic and highly phonemic way of&nbsp; transcribing English speech.&nbsp;
It is based on the ancient Saxon alphabet [900-1066] and the old practice
of inserting trailing double consonants to mark short stressed vowels.&nbsp;
The augmented Latin alphabet [sound-symbol correspondences] was used until
the 15th c. when the pronunciaiton of the long vowels in many words changed.&nbsp;
There was no corresponding change in spelling.&nbsp; This led to a divergence
between spelling and pronunciation.&nbsp; There are two ways to represent
each vowel in Spanglish: stressed or unstressed.&nbsp; Most one syllable
words therefor have two possible spellings.&nbsp; e.g. aet or att,&nbsp;
ej and edj.&nbsp; Spanglish is a parallel pronunciation guide spelling.&nbsp;

dictionary definition is not really suitable for general discussion ("one
of two or more forms of the same phoneme")</font>
<br><font size=-1>...............</font>
<br><font size=-1>I'm not sure that a "free vowel" is always the same as
a "long vowel"; it's more to do with syllable boundaries than length. In
some languages it could well be the same thing, but I don't think it's
automatic.</font>
<br><font size=-1>...............</font>
<br><font size=-1>"inflection" need not be at the end of a word. Welsh
for example changes the sound at the beginning of a word.</font>
<br><font size=-1>...............</font>
<br><font size=-1>"ligature" I'd add "... to make a single character"</font>
<br><font size=-1>..............</font>
<br><font size=-1>"logogram" could include as a more immediate example
the ampersand "&amp;" and all the numerals.</font>
<br><font size=-1>..............</font>
<br><font size=-1>"Roman alphabet" - a possibly dodgy definition, since
only English uses this set of 26! A more roundabout definition (ie one
less vulnerable to pedants) might be "The 26 letters which form the basis
of the alphabet used for Western European languages"?</font>
<br><font size=-1>.............</font>
<br><font size=-1>perhaps you could add: "glide" - a sound that appears
between two others as a side effect of</font>
<br><font size=-1>the pronunciation, for example "lawR and order"</font>
<br><font size=-1>(This is an important phenomenon that figures prominently
in Taam's spellings, so could be worth including)&nbsp; See Truespel</font>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FFFFFF"> Orthography, n. The science
of spelling by the eye instead of by the ear. Advocated with more heat
than light by the outmates of every asylum for the insane.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">They have had to concede a few things since Chaucer's
day, but are none the less hot&nbsp;</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">in defense of those to be conceded hereafter.&nbsp;</font>

indicted</font>

the court ci</font><b><font color="#FFCC00">c</font></b><font color="#FFFFFF">ted.</font>

<p>In Spanglish: What is the last word?
