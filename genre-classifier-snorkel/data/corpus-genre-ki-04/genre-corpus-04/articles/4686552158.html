Devise such a formula. 2.2 A Word on the Dynamic Programming Paradigm ``Dynamic Programming'' is a very general programming technique. It is applicable when a large search space can be structured into a succession of stages, such that the initial stage contains trivial solutions to sub-problems, each partial solution in a later stage can be calculated by recurring on only a fixed number of partial solutions in an earlier stage, the final stage contains the overall solution. This applies to our distance matrix: The columns are the stages, the first column is trivial, the final one contains the overall result. A matrix entry is the partial solution and can be determined from two solutions in the previous column and plus one in the same column, namely . Since calculating edit distances is the predominant approach to sequence comparison, some people simply call this THE dynamic programming algorithm. Just note that the dynamic programming paradigm has many other applications as well, even within bioinformatics. 2.3 A Word on Scoring Functions and Related Notions Many authors use different words for essentially the same idea: scores, weights, costs, distance and similarity functions all attribute a numeric value to a pair of sequences. ``distance'' should only be used when the metric axioms are satisfied. In particular, distance values are never negative. The optimal alignment minimizes distance. The term ``costs'' usually implies positive values, with the overall cost to be minimized. However, metric axioms are not assumed. ``weights'' and ``scores'' can be positive or negative. The most popular use is that a high score is good, i.e. it indicates a lot of similarity. Hence, the optimal alignments maximize scores. The term ``similarity'' immediately implies that large values are good, i.e. an optimal alignment maximizes similarity. Intuitively, one would expect that similarity values should not be negative (what is less than zero similarity?). But don't be surprised to see negative similarity scores shortly. Mathematically, distances are a little more tractable than the others. In terms of programming, general scoring functions are a little more flexible. For example, the algorithm for local similarity presented in section 5.1 depends on the use of both positive and negative scores. The accumulated score of two subsequences may rise above the threshold value, and may fall below it after encountering some negative scores. Let us close with another caveat concerning the influence of sequence length on similarity. Let us just count exact matches and let us assume that two sequences of length and , respectively, have 99 exact matches. Let be the similarity score calculated for and under this cost model. So, . What this means depends on : If , the sequences are very similar - almost identical. If , we have only 10% identity! (Two typos were corrected in this paragraph on Wed May 15 17:06:38 MDT 1996.) So if we relate sequences of varying length, it makes sense to use length-relative scores - rather than we use for sequence comparison. Back to VSNS BioComputing Division Home Page .

``Dynamic Programming'' is a very general programming technique. It is
applicable when a large search space can be structured into a succession of
stages, such that
<UL><LI> the initial stage contains trivial solutions to sub-problems,
<LI> each partial solution in a later stage can be calculated by recurring on
  only a fixed number of partial solutions in an earlier stage,
<LI> the final stage contains the overall solution.
</UL>
<P>
This applies to our distance matrix: The columns are the stages, the first
column is trivial, the final one contains the overall result. A matrix entry
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_18604_tex2html_wrap1316.gif"> is the partial solution <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_18604_tex2html_wrap1318.gif"> and can be
determined from two solutions in the previous column

<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_18604_tex2html_wrap1324.gif">.
Since calculating edit distances is the predominant approach to sequence
comparison, some people simply call this THE dynamic programming

Mathematically, distances are a little more tractable than the others. In terms of

Let <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_18604_tex2html_wrap1344.gif"> be
