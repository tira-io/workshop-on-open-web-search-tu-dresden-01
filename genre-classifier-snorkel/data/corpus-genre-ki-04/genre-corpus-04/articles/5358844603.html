 PL Concepts: Lambda Calculus PL Concepts: Lambda Calculus Lambda calculus is a notation that allows the definition of "unnamed" functions.

<h1>PL Concepts: Lambda Calculus</h1>

<p>Lambda calculus is a notation that allows the definition of
"unnamed" functions.  In particular, the notation permits treating
functions mathematically as first-class objects (well, math doesn't
really deal with objects...).  The notation that defines a function
consists of a lambda, a variable to be used as the input of the
function, a period, and an expression (in terms of the variable) that
defines the output of the function.</p>

<p>In the examples below, <em>L</em> is used in place of a lambda
since HTML doesn't support Greek letters or equations (yet).</p>

<p>A simple function is the identity function:<br>
<tab><em>Id = Lx.x</em><br>
<em>Id</em> is defined to be a function of a variable <em>x</em> that
simply returns <em>x</em>.  Note that this notation is essentially
equivalent to<br>
<tab><em>Id(x) = x</em></p>

<p>Lambda notation is particularly useful in dealing with
<a href="curry.html">curried functions,</a> in that one can define
functions without having to give all the arguments immediately.  For
example,<br>
<tab><em>a = Lx.Ly.x+y</em><br>
defines a function <em>a</em> which, depending on how you look at
it,</p>
<ul>
	<li>takes two arguments (and adds them),</li>
	<li>takes one argument and returns a function of one argument,
or</li>
	<li>takes <em>no</em> arguments and returns a function of two
arguments.</li>
      </ul>
<p>The utility of the lambda notation, particularly with respect to
<a href="curry.html">currying,</a> is thus clear: it allows the
manipulation of functions without excessive concern for naming the
function or defining its arguments immediately.</p>

<p>Lambda calculus is used extensively in denotational semantics; it
also motivated various language constructs, particularly those in
<a href="lisp.html">Lisp</a> and <a href="scheme.html">Scheme.</a></p>

<h2><a name="LambdaCapture">Lambda Capture</a></h2>

<p><em>Lambda capture</em> is the process of "capturing" the meaning
of a function's arguments in the environment in which they belong.
That is, when a function is applied to its arguments, the function's
parameters are bound to the meaning of the arguments outside the
function's environment.  Hence, if the argument contains free
variables, then the parameter is bound to the argument with its free
variables.</p>

<p>The importance of lambda capture is visible primarily when a
function's parameters have the same name as one or more free
variables--for example,<br>
<tab><em>(Lm.(Ln.n+1)(m))(2n)</em><br>
Here, the <em>n</em> in the inner lambda expression is a bound
variable, while the <em>n</em> in the function's argument is a free
variable.  When the outer function (<em>Lm...</em>) is applied to its
argument, the free variable <em>n</em> is captured and is therefore
not confused with the bound variable <em>n</em>.</p>
