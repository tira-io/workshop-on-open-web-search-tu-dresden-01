 Security and Encryption Links Encryption and Security-related Resources The following are security-related resources (aka "the crypto link farm") that I've found on the net. If there's anything which needs updating or correcting, please let me know. Because of its large size, I only update the online version of the page every few months, so please be patient when waiting for updates to reported changes to appear. The complete link farm is around 1/2MB of data, the following links contain the complete collection broken down by topic for ease of access: Crypto Link Farms Crypto Archives Crypto Social Issues Crypto Software Miscellaneous Security Items Public Key Infrastructure Security Agencies and Organizations Security Books, Journals, Bibliographies, and Publications Security People Security Problems Security Products Security Standards, Laws, and Guidelines Thanks to a few overseas readers there are now mirrors of this page available outside New Zealand which should provide faster access for people in Europe and the US. These mirrors are: Canadian mirror (updated manually) German mirror (updated automatically) Italian mirror (updated automatically) Norwegian mirror (updated automatically) Swedish mirror (updated manually) Swedish mirror (updated manually) UK mirror (updated manually) US mirror (updated automatically) In addition there are quite a number of other mirrors or copies around, a Google search will find them.
