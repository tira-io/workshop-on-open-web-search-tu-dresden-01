 Mark Rosenstein's Sailing Page Sailing Page "For the truth is that I already know as much about my fate as I need to know. The day will come when I will die. So the only matter of consequence before me is what I will do with my allotted time. I can remain on shore, paralyzed with fear, or I can raise my sails and dip and soar in the breeze." - Richard Bode, First you have to row a little boat W elcome to my sailing page of internet sailing resources.

This is where I've moved all those other sites, that weren't easily catagorized, but yet I found interesting. Mark wrestling with a Major Boat I'm always open to adding resources to my list, so if you know of other items, give me a holler: mbrmbr@acm.org History: The early history of this site is clouded in the mysteries of my forgetful memory. Initially, the site started out as a page of my sailing bookmarks. Soon after that I, created the site. The earliest file, which I still have, (tall-ships-faq) was modified on June 18 1993. I moved the site off my personal machine when my company installed their first firewall onto an SGI Indigo R4000 called community, located outside the firewall. My log files from that machine begin June 13, 1994. In September 1996, I established the domain apparent-wind.com and in August 1997 began moving visitors from the community machine to apparent-wind.com. In late summer 1998 I turned community off and all traffic is now served from the apparent-wind.com domain. Page last updated: Jul 15 06:38:56 2003 EST.

"For the truth is that I already know as much about my fate as I need
to know. The day will come when I will die. So the only matter of
consequence before me is what I will do with my allotted time. I can
remain on shore, paralyzed with fear, or I can raise my sails and dip
and soar in the breeze."

History: The early history of this site is clouded in the mysteries of my
forgetful memory. Initially, the site started out as a page of my 
sailing bookmarks. Soon after that I, created the site.
The earliest file, which I still have, (tall-ships-faq) was modified on
June 18 1993. I moved the site off my personal machine when my company
installed their first firewall onto an SGI Indigo R4000 called community,
located outside the firewall.
My log files from that machine begin June 13, 1994. In September 1996, I
established the domain apparent-wind.com and in August 1997 began moving
visitors from the community machine to apparent-wind.com. In late summer 1998
I turned community off and all traffic is now served from the apparent-wind.com
domain.
