 Links to American Indian Sites Introductory Page by Phil Konstantin LINKS TO OTHER SITES - Introductory page All opinions & information presented on these sites are solely those of each web page's owner. While I have visited each of these sites when I added them, their inclusion here does not necessarily mean I endorse that group or vouch for their efforts. Parents should supervise children's use of the internet. New sites are marked by a check mark for a few weeks. If you find a link which no longer works properly, or you wish to suggest a site for inclusion in this list, please let me know. In an effort to make these links easier to find, I have sorted them into 16 groups. Each group has sites whose subject matter is primarily under that heading. Look around though, some sites cover many subjects; and I had to put them somewhere. You will find links to all of my links pages at the bottom of each page. Just click on an underlined phrase to go to that page. The large number of links has forced me to add many additional pages.
