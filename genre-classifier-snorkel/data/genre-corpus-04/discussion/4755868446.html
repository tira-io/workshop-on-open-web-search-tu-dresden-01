The patriot act is the worst thing to be excreted out of our nation since homeland security. Nothing like giving the FBI freedom to do VOIP wiretapping and explore any computer with the only reason for the exploration being that of a letter they wrote themselves citing suspected terrorist activities.

When the act is invoked, citizens can be arrested and imprisoned without the benefit of trial or even a stated explanation. It essentially creates a period of martial law in the country. The act has been invoked three times in Canadian history: World War I, World War II, during the October Crisis of 1970. This act has been repealed and was replaced with the Emergencies Act in 1988. BTW, when Prime Minister Trudeau used the WM act in 1970 he didn't have Parliament's approval, nor did he need it to use it. _________________ The cat is right there in the middle, staring at me.

The act has been invoked three times in Canadian history: World War I, World War II, during the October Crisis of 1970.
