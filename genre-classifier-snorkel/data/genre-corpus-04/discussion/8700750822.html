Language evolves I guess and meanings change. I guess we could say that irony is a method of humorous or subtly sarcastic expression in which the intended meaning of the words is the direct opposite of their usual sense. Or as the Oxford English says "A condition of affairs or events of a character opposite to what was, or might naturally be, expected; a contradictory outcome of events as though in mockery of the promise and fitness of things." An example of situational irony would be a man lost in a hot desert and near death from thirst, he crawled aimlessly in search of water. He could hardly believe his good fortune when he came across an oasis. He crawled forward onto its bank, leaned down and was just about to drink his fill when the bank collapsed under him. He fell in the water and drowned.

Supported credibly if not completely enough by it's use as shown in in this document [jhu.edu] which I found when googling for a little support for my hypothesis. What kind of power it is colors it's relationship with the other word part. I believe it's an oppressive sort of power, essentially the military power required to win and the spoils that are the reward (power over the people, to tax and control their economy. Taken this way Democracy has a different meaning, probably justifiable but incomplete. The people should have power over the government but should they take the position with regard to it that historically military governments do? Similarly if people have power of the "government", this is "govern" the correct root for that word? If the intent is to free the people to govern themselves, and free the economy, "democracy" is possibly the wrong approach. Philosophy is stored in these terms. Breaking these terms open, or comparatively considering the distinctions between irony and coincidence, ironic coincidence or literal metaphors. I post this to you because of your clear like for making closer study of terms (I paused to grok your distinction between irony and coincidence), and because you also have a pragmatists view of language, a relatively rare combination. It allows one to look for the meaning of words as a philosophist rather than as a grammarian, trying to impose as RULES what are merely interesting philological patterns.

I think it's fair to say that philosophers mostly mine language for knowledge, as special kinds of philologists. As for the additional part, the creativity, it's mostly aimed in the direction of creating new words and new understandings for them, and is therefore just another part of the same process.

Eric's design was cool, he explained it to me a few years back, and it has seen use in other projects than the kernel. But I could see that it would be difficult for the kernel developers to accept: It required Python to build the kernel. It was complicated. It included an entire theorem prover. This was sort of cool in that it would not allow you to generate a non-working configuration, but really more than was required for the job. Its language was arcane. The main language idiom is the suppress-unless statement, which is sort of the logical negation of if-then statements. And some folks questioned his motivation for getting this grandiose project into the kernel - was it just to help out, or was it primarily to establish additional hacker reputation for Eric? I'd be willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on this - he did the work. I think he had a chance of getting it in, but he would have had to refactor the entire thing, write it over in C, make the language cleaner, and I guess that didn't come about. But to his credit, he didn't just talk about it. He generated a working software product with functionality that did not previously exist in Open Source as far as I could tell. His project is worth studying, and I'd encourage works derived from his ideas. I'm sure there's a paper about it online.

I mean, come on, the guy just wanted to help make things better! Getting booed off the stage hurts! First, GNU/Linux will never be accepted "by everyone." Nor will FreeBSD, nor will BeOS, nor will Apple's OS X. Nor will Microsoft Windows, unless Palladium and DRM is legislated into law by the likes of "Disney" Hollings, and even then Apple is likely to be kept around as a token "competitor," paying hefty patent fees to Microsoft for the privelege of being allowed to manufacture "legal" hardware in the US. Unless, of course, you get off your butt and do something [randomfoo.net] about it, but I digress. The problem is a simple and obvious one, and the solution as elusive today as it was the first time humans came to live together (and likely predates our ability to speak): Politics is ugly and banal , and people are fallible. This includes the Linux kernel developers and Linus Torvalds himself. Example: The ggi project wanted to provide a kernel abstraction layer for video hardware in the same manner such abstractions are presented for everything else, from your ethernet adapter to your system's RAM and hard drive. Linus thought the idea sucked, then ended up doing a "poor man's" version of frame buffer support instead. How much better things would have been if the original vision of the GGI folks had been realized and supported we'll never know. Example: PCMCIA. It is still a mess. The more capable userspace version got sidelined in favor of a broken and less capable rewrite ... I can only ascribe that to politics and personal pull, which every group, no matter how altruistic and well meaning, falls prey to now and then. There are other examples, and perhaps Eric S. Raymond's effort is one (though I hesitate to make that assumption), but the purpose of this post is not to catalogue the mistakes Linus and others have made, or to air my own disagreements with them (but what the hell: when will we get XFS into the main kernel tree damn it! :-)), but rather to point out their humanity and fallability, a trait they share with everyone reading this comment, the guy posting it, and probably with every sapient being, everywhere. Mistakes happen, everywhere, by everyone. The measure of a group or project's success isn't their perfection (as is so often implied in political discussions), it is by how much their mistaken decisions are outweighed by their correct decisions. And using that metric, the Kernel developers, including Linus Torvalds, have done very well indeed.

KGI (the code to go into the kernel) was just a bit more sophisticated than DRI. Under KGI, the mode switching would be provided by the kernel so that you never lost all use of your console because of X crashing, text blitting routines would be included in the kernel to support Linux's in kernel terminal, for hardware with an accel engine an interface is provided for the driver to tell userspace what accel methods are available. It is as simple as that. KGI was never "acceleration in the kernel" as was shouted about a lot, it was "operations that can render your console or system bus unusable are allowed with care taken to ensure that nothing bad can happen while maintaining DRI level performance". For matrox (a good, stable accel interface), userspace could query what interface is available and the driver might respond "matrox mmap interface" since it is safe to mmap the accel registers from userspace. If there were any code to operate the accel registers they would be in a badly designed driver (or a driver for badly designed hardware), and nothing to do with KGI *at* *all*. KGI is the minimum necessary to safely support high performance graphics from userspace and that's not a lot.

The userbase of the kernel config system is the kernel developers; they had several tried-and-true ways of configuring kernels. Many of them were in fact quite happy with the existing system, and didn't see a need to upgrade at all; there was a general consensus that there were some shortcomings in the existing system, but those were very specific. ESR solved these problems very well with CML2. By he also added a dozen features and changed a hundred other minor things, simply because he felt it was better that way. ESR was solving problems which only he perceived. For example, he was very interested in making it easy for "Aunt Tillie" to configure a kernel. Unfortunately, Aunt Tillie doesn't have a say in whether something goes into the kernel. Linus was apparently OK with CML2, but most of the other kernel developers were very resistant. No one ever explicitly refused CML2, but it never went in either, and ESR eventually gave up. The impression I got was that ESR should have minimized the changes to the UI in his first version. If he had built something exactly like the old config, but with a new language and backend, most of the objections would have gone away. He then could have submitted the other changes; they may or may not have been accepted, but at least the underlying system would have been improved.

I was the CML1 maintainer for two years, and I had a front-row seat for the CML2 fiasco. ESR went for a big incompatible rewrite, in a new not-universally-deployed language, with a lot of paradigm shifts. Technically, this was okay. It's good to broom things out every now and then and the existing system is a mess. (The hardest part is dealing with module symbol versions, which are truly bletcherous). Socially, this made CML2 a big pill to swallow. And ESR didn't help things. In my opinion, he never acknowledged that lots of smart hard-working people were using the existing system to get a lot of work done. He came across as a bad advocate ("your system is stupid, and you are stupid for using it") rather than a good advocate ("this new system will fix the two things that you are bitching about the most"). Also, it hurt a lot that there was a big mismatch between ESR's priorities of caring and the user's priorities of caring. To ESR, it was unimportant that the system was implemented in Python. To most other people, it was very important. To ESR, a correctness prover was very cool. To most other people, it wasn't very important. One notorious mismatch was between Linus's strong desire to break up the monolithic help text into hundreds of files, and Eric's assessment of that task as minor. Eventually it turned into a pissing contest, with a lot of people pissing on ESR because he was clueless about making his software work in its social/ecological niche. And when lots of people piss on a guy, of course he pisses back. And then the debacle happens, where no useful software happens, no useful ideas happen, a lot of people waste a lot of time in flame wars and stop listening to each other. During this time, Alan Cox was one of the few people who stayed calm and looked at CML2 technically, without getting into the ad hominem battles. I respect Alan very much for his ability to do that. Alan had a negative opinion and gave good reasons why he didn't like it -- reasons that ESR should have listened very carefully to, I think. Perhaps the worst part is that CML2 has lots of cool ideas, but we got into a position where the cool ideas can't even serve as experience for the next generation of people who want to take a crack at the problem, because of the ad hominem poisoning.

Not intuitive. Not to mention the millions of chipset names. In Windows, you choose the name of your card, and it figures out the chipset (that's in the worst case; usually it just auto-detects it in the first place). In Linux, you have to figure out who made the chipset on your card, which often isn't labeled on the box or in the manual, so requires some guessing or googling. An easy-to-find example is the emu10k1 for Soundblaster Live cards (this is actually documented by Creative); a harder-to-find example is the tulip driver for LinkSys network cards (most of the $ 10 LinkSys cards don't come with a manual, and the box doesn't mention what chipset they use).

That way if you discover you need some functionality, you don't have to recompile the kernel; just load the required module.

I've tried emailing the BTTV developer for *any* advice, or any experience of such lock-ups, etc, but he never replied. So what can I do? Well, basically I can either never use my TV card until I'm able to buy parts for a second (well, fourth...) system just to do TV capture, or I can keep trying various settings to see if I can ever make it stop hanging, whilst my FS gets slowly corrupted..

The situation isn't the fault of Linux or of Linux programmers, though, it's down to the manufacturers- they supply disks of drivers for windows, which AFAIK mostly consist of the chipset manufacturer's drivers, plus data to tell windows that this product is to be using those drivers, or something along those lines. Those that produce stuff that also works with Linux could fairly easily indicate so on the packaging, and some of them actually do, but most don't, because they wouldn't be able to supply some pretty installer program that would cover up the details like they could for Windows.

The correct solution to make hardware configuration usable for the masses is not to make building a kernel easier but to make building a kernel unnecessary. The system has become more modular over time.[1] Hardware has become friendlier to autodetection. Distributions like RedHat come with a single kernel that will work for just about anyone. When you start up with new hardware, kudzu will recognize it, ask you about it, and load the appropriate driver.

Yes, some easy things (Microsoft Bob) are really bad, and some difficult things are good, but Linux, like Unix in general (sorry to generalize but it's a cultural inheritance), suffers from an "old boys' club" mentality in which earned knowledge of arcana is viewed as an entry point. Sort of like morse code has been to ham radio -- there aren't rational reasons to require it any more (though some of us actually like to use it, sportingly), but removing the requirement brings out all sorts of anger from old timers who had to learn it. Where it currently bugs me the most: Gentoo looks like a swell distro. Installing from source ends dependency hell and optimizes performance; I can buy it. But the setup is dreadful, basically more Linux From Scratch than anything else. The topic of an installer came up on Gentoo Forums. The "consensus" of the Gentoo user base is that "Gentoo is a hard distribution, and so the installation should be hard too." What rot! Once installed, no distribution should be gratuitously hard to live with. And while Gentoo lacks some of the GUI tools of say Mandrake or Red Hat, it's basically a clean system that shouldn't be that hard to manage. But the install procedure basically consists of printing out a lengthy set of instructions and doing a lot of hand edits of files, step by step, and hoping your system is enough like the developers' to work right. Personally I don't find the current kernel config (make xconfig) to be that hard, just a little nerve-racking where some new options show up that I don't understand. Which is what Bruce set out to fix. We can quibble about implementation details but his heart's in the right place. Linux won't prosper so long as it lives with the old boys' mentality.

The people you call schoolyard bullies are the people who have done the most to make the kernel the great piece of code that it is. Linus is an amazing manager of code and people . What Linus did in both cases (CML2/ESR and IDE/Dalecki) was actually good management. Marcin said he had enough because people kept complaining that the IDE code was unstable but Linus supported him for as long as he produced good and promising code. When Marcin gave up, Linus went back to what was stable. Nobody else really knew how Marcin Dalecki's new code worked and it still had bugs so Linus made the smartest move: go back to crufty but stable and known code that works. Linus (and Linux) can not afford to have core maintainer's who are not tough with "thick hides" and "stiff backbones" who sometimes look like "bully's" because if a maintainer gives up on a project, that part of the kernel may "bit rot", and truly become unusable. Linus plays the game of "survival of the fittest" in both code and developers. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen. When Marcin closed up shop, Linus did not ask "please someone take this promising code I put in of Marcin's and make it work right" or say Marcin please dont go!. Instead he said "fine" and went back to what worked. If someone wants to take over Marcins work and make it work right, Linus might put it back in but Linus is not looking for ideals or promising code; he is looking for results. The case of ESR is different but similar. ESR made a lot of changes (that not everybody was happy with) with a lot of promise but he had had enough and gave up as well. Now there is someone else at the mantle of configuration (writing far less controversial code) and hopefully STRONG enough to take the heat. Linus knows that no one person or piece of code is vital to the whole. If something really needs to be fixed, he knows that someone will come along and eventually do it but he has no patience for what should or could or want in kernel development. The schoolyard bullies work hard to weed out the best code from contributors and send them on to Linus and despite people like you giving them a hard time, they have proven that they are tough enough to take it and keep on producing while ESR and Marcin Dalecki proved they werent.

There are several messages like this here and I have to wonder how you have developed the leg strength to be able to jump to these kinds of conclusions. True, some of the developers can be caustic, but I don't think it's unreasonable for people to be adults about things. If you can't handle criticism you should go develop for a nursery school or something. The kernel developers are not babysitters. They don't have time to hold your hand, and encourage you, and give you applause and little paper prizes every time you do something right. There were many good and valid objections to ESR's system. Not all of them were, but many were. The largest objection (iirc) was to his attitude. Particularly when it looked like things weren't going to go his way. The IDE system issues were even more complex. Marcin was working hard to clean it up, but his changes often reached into other areas, and had consequences outside of the ide area. Some of the changes broke functionality some people depended on. Obviously, these people were upset. More than that, his changes made running 2.5 on an ide system risky. That, I think, was what got him the most negative feedback. Especially when he wrote it off as the cost of improvments. A broken ide subsystem made it difficult for many developers to work on and test the 2.5 kernel. Which, in turn, delayed improvements to other subsystems and completion of other projects. Was this Marcin's fault? Probably not. In general they probably would've been better off setting up a "new" ide tree like they're doing now before. Regardless, eventually he had enough. It's very sad that all of his hard work has now had to be removed from the kernel. It is a shame that it's going to go to waste. However, I don't think you can say the problem was just a bunch of schoolyard bullies knocking a newcomer. That was not the case at all. In other areas we have things like the new kbuild that was written by Keith Owens. This is a really nice system, it still hasn't gone in. (Amazingly, it was left out of this post, though I'd count it as far more likely to get in than CML2.) The only real contention here is that keith wants a flag-day change, and linus wants it in pieces. It'll (hopefully) eventually all get in, as it is being chopped up and added in in pieces, though how it'll ever make it completely this way without something akin to a FDC is beyond me. (Doesn't mean it's not possible, I just don't see how). All of these things are real issues that are brought up. Nobody is rejecting patches or ideas because they come from an unknown. Nobody is rejecting ideas because they don't like the way the person looks/smells/types their sig or any other superficial reasons.

Bottom line, not too many people aren't replacable and any work you do can probably be done by somebody else, they don't need politicians.

Further, people are working on the configuartion language but there are bigger problems to be solved, everyone knows it and still the efforts don't fully address them. Like how do you know the configuation options used on the kernel you are running? There is no reason to change just for the sake of change and compilation speed isn't a huge issue, my dual amd compiles kernels so fast I don't care if I cut the speed in half. Plus, when you're hacking you usually work on a module or two and don't rebuild the whole thing. The process is good, they don't take crap. The VM system and the IDE system are other prime examples. Al Viro is kind of mean to people but everyone else makes it pretty clear what needs to be done, why things aren't accpeted, even Al has expectations that he makes clear. There are expectations for robustness, it's more important than performance.

There have been a handful of people who just don't cut it. Believe me, they can be replaced. It sucks, it'll be a dark day when Alan Cox or Dave Miller quit, if they ever do but they also know the rules, they play by them and they have their own forks if they don't agree.

In order to replace something that everyone has to use, you have to replace it with something that just works for everybody, including the people writing rules, people who want to keep their old configs, people who want to maintain code for both the new kernels and old kernels, and so forth. The whole "Aunt Tillie" thing really is an issue, because important kernel developers don't want to spend more thought on configuring the kernel they're building than Aunt Tillie would, and they already have routine ways of doing that. "Technical superiority" is a subjective thing, and "does it configure the kernel" is not the only factor. At least as important is "is switching to it easier than continuing to use the existing tools". Incidentally, the problem with the old build system was not that it was too slow to build but that, if you changes a few things and rebuilt, either you did a complete rebuild, which was too slow, or you just rebuilt the module you were working on, which didn't necessarily catch all of the changes. The new versions are moving toward giving you the ability to rebuild only those things which actually need to be rebuilt without making you know what things these are. People frequently report problems where they've forgotten to do the right thing after they've changed something. Making the current kernel's configuration available isn't actually difficult at all; it's just that userspace generally has the information anyway (most people copy the config file somewhere parallel to the kernel image). The hard thing is configuring a new kernel version to match the effects of the config file for an old kernel version: sometimes the options change, sometimes there are new options required for old things, etc. Eric's motivation for doing CML2 and defying Linus (Score:2) by iskander (9699) on Sunday September 08, @07:02PM ( #4217908 ) There were a few times when Linus made it very clear what he wanted changed and ESR simply didn't fix it, it was as if he didn't even hear it; look at the threads in the kernel archive.

That means that in order to use certain hardware or other features, the drivers have to reside in the kernel itself. Now, lets suppose that you just got the latest gee wiz device and you want to use it on your Linux box. You hook your "flux capacitor" up to the firewire port and nothing happens. Why, because either a firewire or a flux capacitor driver (or both) is required and the kernel doesn't have it installed. This means that you must rebuild the kernel with the appropriate driver in order for your new flux capacitor to work. Now, some may argue that the kernels should be pre-built with all the drivers and everything. Indeed, many distros do something like this for their stock kernels. But that still doesn't account for hardware that is yet to be invented. It also causes the kernel to grow into a giant that gives the term monolithic a whole new meaning. This large size means slow boot times and slower overall performance, in some cases. Surely, you don't want that? Indeed, many people want to trim the size of their kernel to an absolute minimum to improve the performance of their system, not to mention the security enhancement of removing unneccessary services. Do you really need HAM radio support? Most people don't, so why would most people want the HAM drivers loaded in their kernel? Do you need NTFS file system support, as I do? Probably not, especially with write access, so why include it? But at the same time, why prevent me from using it, as I need to? Even without the above reasons requiring the custom kernel, there is one more reason in favor of it. Part of the whole idea behind Linux is the ability to modify and customize it to your heart's content. That means if you want to modify your kernel you can. And this project will make such modifications easier than in the past. If you don't want to bother with customizing your kernel, then use the latest stock kernel from a major distribution, which will have mostly everything included. But, if it is slow or your flux capacitor isn't supported, you'll just have to wait and hope that the distro includes the support in its next release. Re:Custom kernels for custom systems.

It CAN be; but every distribution I've used comes with a modular kernel, with most options compiled as modules which are loaded and unloaded as needed. This is also how most people compile their kernels. It is very possible to compile them monolithically; but then you're guaranteeing that you'll need a recompile with any hardware changes.

Linux *is* a monolithic kernel, period, because all of its code runs at the kernel level. Contrast with microkernels which only consist of the bare minimum of code needed to manage the OS. Most of the drivers (network, disk, maybe even some memory stuff) live outside of the main kernel and execute in user space, similar to any other process only with slighly elevated priority and access to hardware. The type of loadable modules implemented in the Linux kernel gives it one of the primary advantages of a microkernel--the ability to load and remove *certain* drivers at run-time--but it doesn't change the fact that it's still monolithic.

Why, because either a firewire or a flux capacitor driver (or both) is required and the kernel doesn't have it installed. This means that you must rebuild the kernel with the appropriate driver in order for your new flux capacitor to work. No it does not. It means, in this case, you must rebuild a module. Rebuilding an entire kernel for this purcpose is a waste of time and energy. But realistically, you'd already have the module available - to follow your own example, user A might not use NTFS support, but having the driver available as a module doesn't harm his own system - the kernel isn't bigger because of it. It also allows user B to mount his Windows disk easily with only a slight overhead from loading the driver as a module rather than having it compile into the kernel. The solution is more modularity.

Simply not true. When all I had was a VT100 command set, I wrote terminal interfaces that a 4 year old could use for fairly complicated pieces of software, no mouse required. Although it did use windows....of a sort. As for configuring and building a kernel, beyond: 1) Interfaces to remove and pull out components on demand.... 2) The interface should provide optional documentation and guidelines as well as best practices for most kernel configs given the applications the machine is going to be running. (i.e. Will it be a router, firewall, an app server or database server?) 3) The configuration system should be easily scriptable with a minimal set of gcc utils. (sh, make, config..etc.) This is so that it requires less software to build the kernel. This implies inherent reduced security risks, smaller kernel distribution and less dependancies for linux systems integrators. Eric S Raymonds vision fails on all three accounts as far as I can tell, on how a kernel should be built and what the logical assumptions are for building a kernel in the first place. Primarily, users, shouldn't be building kernels anyway. Which is what I think the root problem is here. No, I don't think either, that there is something wrong with Linux if a user can't do EVERYTHING with a mouse and windows. Lets be realistic here: Users do not have the background to properly build a kernel, and building a nice graphical front end too build a kernel for a sophisticated developer gets in the way. It also, doesn't detract from Linux one iota simply because this fact exists. That is what the argument here is, and that is why many people who write kernel programs don't use graphical tools ANYWAY. Which I think breaks another assumption made by Mr. Raymond about a new config system. Dependancy graphics are nice, rules seperation parsers built to create such graphics with a language are nice.

Very nice, simple and it works very well very nicely without Python, X, windows, Mice a supported video driver and a whole new set of tools that basically give us the same thing we have now, just a whole lot more complicated.

I'm gonna have to go with a "smart choice" option on behalf of MS. Think about it. They are giving away a FREE DVD. Lots of people probably grabbed it for shits and giggles. Out of those 3,000 people, if MS locks just 1%, then the mission is accomplished.

However, the changes usually should be incrimental rather than all-at-once. This forces better code, and better systems, and all-round better products. Ad astra per aspera.

				Just felt like a rant @ 4am<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Ignore me. Language evolves I guess and meanings change. <BR><BR>I guess we could say that irony is a method of humorous or subtly sarcastic expression in which the intended meaning of the words is the direct opposite of their usual sense.<BR><BR>Or as the Oxford English says "A condition of affairs or events of a character opposite to what was, or might naturally be, expected; a contradictory outcome of events as though in <BR>mockery of the promise and fitness of things."<BR><BR>An example of situational irony would be a man lost in a hot desert and near death from thirst, he crawled aimlessly in search of water. He could hardly believe his good fortune when he came across an oasis. He crawled forward onto its bank, leaned down and was just about to drink his fill when the bank collapsed under him. He fell in the water and drowned.<BR><BR>As Ralph Wiggam said "Me fail English? that's unpossible".<BR><BR>

				kratos:<BR><BR>I think that it also is a specific kind of power.  Supported credibly if not completely enough by it's use as shown in <A HREF="http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/nagy/BofATL/chapter5.html">in this document</A> [jhu.edu] which I found when googling for a little support for my hypothesis.  What kind of power it is colors it's relationship with the other word part.  I believe it's an oppressive sort of power, essentially the military power required to win and the spoils that are the reward (power over the people, to tax and control their economy.  Taken this way Democracy has a different meaning, probably justifiable but incomplete.  The people should have power over the government but should they take the position with regard to it that historically military governments do?  Similarly if people have power of the "government", this is "govern" the correct root for that word?  If the intent is to free the people to govern themselves, and free the economy, "democracy" is possibly the wrong approach.  <BR><BR>Philosophy is stored in these terms.  Breaking these terms open, or comparatively considering the distinctions between irony and coincidence, ironic coincidence or literal metaphors.  I post this to you because of your clear like for making closer study of terms (I paused to grok your distinction between irony and coincidence), and because you also have a pragmatists view of language, a relatively rare combination.  It allows one to look for the meaning of words as a philosophist rather than as a grammarian, trying to impose as RULES what are merely interesting philological patterns.

				all the battles in philosophy, by which I mean not the academic ones but the real battles that go on within cultures and when they collide, are all stored, I believe, in the terms and phrases of language.  <BR><BR>I think it's fair to say that philosophers mostly mine language for knowledge, as special kinds of philologists.  As for the additional part, the creativity, it's mostly aimed in the direction of creating new words and new understandings for them, and is therefore just another part of the same process.<BR><BR>I hope to talk with you about this more in the future at some point. <BR><BR>Cheers.

				I can't agree with your second point more.<BR><BR>"Literally" is a word that you use when you want to cut through layers upon layers of misued metaphors, ambiguous sarcasm, and other kinds misdirection,<BR><BR>It's like a reserved word.  Or, better yet, it's like an escape character.

				I think there's even more to abusing the word "literally" than giving it the <i>opposite</i> meaning. People who talk like that also mean some form of "very", or worse, a kind of, "Take me seriously this time because I reeaaalllly mean it!"<p>
Oddly, even though misuse of "literally" irritates the living f### out of me, I think it <i>should</i> have the meaning people end up giving it when they (mis)use it to add emphasis. For example:<p>
"That was so funny I literally shit myself."<p>
"How disgusting. You will go home and change your underwear. Right?"<p>
"No I won't you cyborg. There isn't any poop in my pants. It was just an expression. I meant that in a <i>literary</i> way!"<p>

				The kernel developers are a pretty open-minded bunch. Eric's design was cool, he explained it to me a few years back, and it has seen use in other projects than the kernel. But I could see that it would be difficult for the kernel developers to accept:<p> <ul>
<li>It required Python to build the kernel.
<li>It was complicated. It included an entire theorem prover. This was sort of cool in that it would not allow you to generate a non-working configuration, but really more than was required for the job.
<li>Its language was arcane. The main language idiom is the suppress-unless statement, which is sort of the logical negation of if-then statements.
<li>And some folks questioned his motivation for getting this grandiose project into the kernel - was it just to help out, or was it primarily to establish additional hacker reputation for Eric? I'd be willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on this - he did the work.
</ul>I think he had a chance of getting it in, but he would have had to refactor the entire thing, write it over in C, make the language cleaner, and I guess that didn't come about. But to his credit, he didn't just talk about it. He generated a working software product with functionality that did not previously exist in Open Source as far as I could tell. His project is worth studying, and I'd encourage works derived from his ideas.
I'm sure there's a paper about it online.<p> <i>Bruce</i>

</em> </p>
<p>
I grasp the significance of the other three points
of contention you mention, but the fourth (above)
doesn't jump out and grab me as an issue in and of
itself. On the one hand, it may be that the method
was overly complex (evidenced in part by the Python
requirement and an unfamiliar idiom). Disallowing an
unworkable configuration doesn't seem unreasonable,
though. Is there a down-side to building that
safety into the configurator apart from any flaws
[heightened complexity] in Eric's particular implementation?

				Y'all can shut up now.  I have been duly advised that I had the wrong TLA person writing Emacs, and that Emacs is the One True Editor.  I was trying to make a point, but I missed horribly.  At the time, a lisp interpreter in a text editor was a horrendously big thing to do.  I use and love Emacs, I just think that, at first look, it's a ridiculous concept.

				Python wasn't the problem, a few people didn't like it.  I don't even remember anyone trying to veto it for it's complexity or anything either.  There were 2 issues.  It didn't do what Linus wanted it to do, namely decentralize a few thing, Eric simply ignored the requests for that.  And then he tried to slide it in some how without peer review by trying to get developers closer to Linus to endorse it an include it rather than doing it in the open.

He didn't write them, he wrote <b>about</b> them. Whether he's correct on all these points is another matter. It may be that hackers write for reputation but it seems that the appearance of writing for reputation is bad.

				This will happen more and more. I really do expect that at some point someone will just say fuck it and branch their own version of Linux. I see this as possibly a good thing. If this branched version gets all the cool patches that Linus and co are turning down, and they work, it may prove to be a catalyst for change. Either that or the branched version will become better than the original. It happened with XEmacs (which IMHO is much better than Emacs), I see no logical reason it couldn't happen here aswell.

				&gt;  GGI tried to do too much and it abstracted too far.<BR><BR>KGI (the code to go into the kernel) was just a bit more sophisticated than DRI. Under KGI, the mode switching would be provided by the kernel so that you never lost all use of your console because of X crashing, text blitting routines would be included in the kernel to support Linux's in kernel terminal, for hardware with an accel engine an interface is provided for the driver to tell userspace what accel methods are available. It is as simple as that. KGI was never "acceleration in the kernel" as was shouted about a lot, it was "operations that can render your console or system bus unusable are allowed with care taken to ensure that nothing bad can happen while maintaining DRI level performance".<BR><BR>For matrox (a good, stable accel interface), userspace could query what interface is available and the driver might respond "matrox mmap interface" since it is safe to mmap the accel registers from userspace. If there were any code to operate the accel registers they would be in a badly designed driver (or a driver for badly designed hardware), and nothing to do with KGI *at* *all*.<BR><BR>KGI is the minimum necessary to safely support high performance graphics from userspace and that's not a lot.

				<BLOCKQUOTE> <I>
Example: The ggi project wanted to provide a kernel abstraction layer for video hardware in the same manner such abstractions are presented for everything else, from your ethernet adapter to your system's RAM and hard drive. Linus thought the idea sucked, then ended up doing a "poor man's" version of frame buffer support instead. How much better things would have been if the original vision of the GGI folks had been realized and supported we'll never know.
</I> </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I don't agree with your interpretation for why the GGI failed. 

<P>The way I saw it, the GGI developers had very grand ideas but insufficient time/resources.  In the end, the GGI lost out because FB and the DRI offered something tangible with a reduced complexity. Maybe you could argue that GGI offered more but that's just confirmation of the classic 80/20 rule.

				Just to add to Bruce's points above: from what I heard, the biggest problem wasn't technical, but rather ESR's refusal to negotiate. The userbase of the kernel config system is the kernel developers; they had several tried-and-true ways of configuring kernels. Many of them were in fact quite happy with the existing system, and didn't see a need to upgrade at all; there was a general consensus that there were some shortcomings in the existing system, but those were very specific.<BR><BR>ESR solved these problems very well with CML2. By he also added a dozen features and changed a hundred other minor things, simply because he felt it was better that way. ESR was solving problems which only he perceived. For example, he was very interested in making it easy for "Aunt Tillie" to configure a kernel. Unfortunately, Aunt Tillie doesn't have a say in whether something goes into the kernel. Linus was apparently OK with CML2, but most of the other kernel developers were very resistant. No one ever explicitly refused CML2, but it never went in either, and ESR eventually gave up.<BR><BR>The impression I got was that ESR should have minimized the changes to the UI in his first version. If he had built something exactly like the old config, but with a new language and backend, most of the objections would have gone away. He then could have submitted the other changes; they may or may not have been accepted, but at least the underlying system would have been improved.

				<i>The biggest problem wasn't technical, but rather ESR's refusal to negotiate</i>.<BR><BR>I was the CML1 maintainer for two years, and I had a front-row seat for the CML2 fiasco.<BR><BR>ESR went for a big incompatible rewrite, in a new not-universally-deployed language, with a lot of paradigm shifts.  Technically, this was okay.  It's good to broom things out every now and then and the existing system is a mess.  (The hardest part is dealing with module symbol versions, which are truly bletcherous).<BR><BR>Socially, this made CML2 a big pill to swallow.  And ESR didn't help things.  In my opinion, he never acknowledged that lots of smart hard-working people were using the existing system to get a lot of work done.  He came across as a bad advocate ("your system is stupid, and you are stupid for using it") rather than a good advocate ("this new system will fix the two things that you are bitching about the most").<BR><BR>Also, it hurt a lot that there was a big mismatch between ESR's priorities of caring and the user's priorities of caring.  To ESR, it was unimportant that the system was implemented in Python.  To most other people, it was very important.  To ESR, a correctness prover was very cool.  To most other people, it wasn't very important.<BR><BR>One notorious mismatch was between Linus's strong desire to break up the monolithic help text into hundreds of files, and Eric's assessment of that task as minor.<BR><BR>Eventually it turned into a pissing contest, with a lot of people pissing on ESR because he was clueless about making his software work in its social/ecological niche.  And when lots of people piss on a guy, of course he pisses back.  And then the debacle happens, where no useful software happens, no useful ideas happen, a lot of people waste a lot of time in flame wars and stop listening to each other.<BR><BR>During this time, Alan Cox was one of the few people who stayed calm and looked at CML2 technically, without getting into the ad hominem battles.  I respect Alan very much for his ability to do that.  Alan had a negative opinion and gave good reasons why he didn't like it -- reasons that ESR should have listened very carefully to, I think.<BR><BR>Perhaps the worst part is that CML2 has lots of cool ideas, but we got into a position where the cool ideas can't even serve as experience for the next generation of people who want to take a crack at the problem, because of the ad hominem poisoning.<BR>

				I know what hardware I have in my computer.  But Linux often either labels it strangely, or labels it completely wrongly because of its bizarre way of operating.  For example, I have not a single piece of SCSI hardware in my system.  Yet for my <i>IDE</i> CD burner to work, I have to load the ide-scsi module, because apparently CD burning in Linux has only been implemented for SCSI burners, so the only way to get IDE burners to work is to emulate them as SCSI burners.  Not intuitive.<BR><BR>Not to mention the millions of chipset names.  In Windows, you choose the name of your card, and it figures out the chipset (that's in the worst case; usually it just auto-detects it in the first place).  In Linux, you have to figure out who made the chipset on your card, which often isn't labeled on the box or in the manual, so requires some guessing or googling.  An easy-to-find example is the emu10k1 for Soundblaster Live cards (this is actually documented by Creative); a harder-to-find example is the tulip driver for LinkSys network cards (most of the $10 LinkSys cards don't come with a manual, and the box doesn't mention what chipset they use).  And so on for ever.<BR><BR>The Debian way of solving this is by default to build almost everything in the kernel as a module.  That way if you discover you need some functionality, you don't have to recompile the kernel; just load the required module.  It makes kernel compiling take a bit longer (~20 mins on my Athlon 1.33 GHz), but it's worth it IMHO for never having to recompile it again (until the next kernel upgrade anyway).

				Nope, it makes perfect sense. Most CD drives and burners use ATAPI.<BR>From the google glossary at labs.google.com:<BR><BR>Advanced Technology Packet Interface: a specification that defines device side characteristics for an IDE connected peripheral, such as CD-ROM or tape drives. ATAPI is essentially an adaptation of the SCSI command set to the IDE interface.<BR><BR>ide-scsi is not really SCSI emulation. It is just SCSI over IDE.

You say it like it is some kind of magic. There is no magic to this, somebody has to figure out how the hardware is working. If you don't want to figure that out by yourself, you shouldn't compile your own kernels. All distributions comes with precompiled kernels, and you can usually also download precompiled updates.<BR> <BR>
BTW I found almost everything I needed to know about CD recording in the CD-Writing-HOWTO.

				At least with Debian, the precompiled kernel doesn't automatically have CD burning properly set up.  You have to load the required modules and pass them the proper arguments, as I described in my previous post (and yes, I got the requisite steps from the CD-Writing-HOWTO).  In Windows, it detects the hardware and sets it up for you.

				In that case, you are on the wrong thread. This discussion is about the kernel configuration utility. This is not a utility any newbie should ever touch. The people at Debian, Mandrake, Redhat, and all the others could be going to use this utility to configure the kernel for their distributions. But this is in no way related to the hardware detection and setup you are talking about.<BR> <BR>
The installation and configuration utilities you are talking about are developed mostly by the individual distributors, and is a completely different issue.<BR> <BR>
If a newbie want to compile his own kernel, he should use the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.config file that came with his distribution and then just use "make oldconfig". A graphical version of oldconfig, that provides help about the options and sane defaults, is the best we can do to help newbies that insist on compiling their own kernels.<BR> <BR>
Except from this the newbies should only use the kernel configuration utility if they know exactly what option they need to change.

Now (in_.jp) almost all CD-R(W), DVD-R(W) DVD+R(W) is either atapi, usb2 or firewire. Wether or not it 'really' is scsi, perception is reality and the box says its atapi and it works as a cd-rom using ide-atapi drivers, but EVERYONE has to go searching through the documentation to find out that Linux has this quaint approach to burners. <BR><BR>Why not just say THESE ARE ATAPI DRIVERS FOR YOUR ATAPI BURNER and if everyone should know that it's really just scsi over ide, tell them that it requires scsi and explain why in a note somewhere, but make the ATAPI drivers as ATAPI drivers instead of creating this headache. The use of CD and DVD media is an area where Linux is a LONG way behind in terms of usability and this is NOT just an issue with codec use in the USA. Could the virtual_/dev system coming up fix this. <BR><BR>1.../dev/cdrom<BR>2.../dev/cd-r and a disk cache<BR>3.../dev/cd-rw<BR><BR>ABC<BR><BR>anyway back to how after why. If someone could make a better configure tool to know all of these things and do a check for compatibility requirements before saving, like a package management tool and give you a chance to go back and check that one box you missed, without having to make, install and boot your kernel only to discover that you missed something somewhere (maybe).<BR><BR>The heirarchical package selection system in a single window used by package managers might groan a little, but if it could allow you to look at a single screen and say I want drivers for CD burners (atapi or USB?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) and USB HIDs  and core linux, legacy , network and/or CD/DVD file systems and whatever else, then allow those who want/need to, to go in and look for their cards, devices, file systems, character sets, whatever.

				I would actually place the blame for this on hardware makers, for making it so difficult to find out exactly what chipset is driving their product.<BR><BR>e.g. I was given a spare Asante ethernet card recently, and neither the vendor's site nor an extensive Google search could tell me what chipset it used. In desparation I peeled off the "Asante" sticker on the big chip in the middle of the board, and guess what, beneath the chip said "PNIC" on it. If the vendor had cared to mention its card was PNIC-based, I would not have had to waste so much time...<BR><BR>Network card makers seem to be the worst about this, followed by sound card companies. At least with video cards the chipset is usually part of the product name. (e.g. Super Whizbang Turbo Alpha Killer Mega GeForce 2)

Hmm, since I started using Linux, my own approach to
this has been, to firstly get a very clear idea of what
devices and chipsets Linux currently supports, and then
go look for those exact devices or devices that I can
see have those chipsets.<P>
The only problem arises that
my Hauppauge WinTV card (supported by the bttv
module), conflicts with my c-media sound card
(supported by cmpci module) and apparently
some other aspect of my system, to
cause my machine to lock solidly if I try to use the
TV card. -Note that I say there is some other aspect
to it, because every other sound card I've tried with
it (there have been a few) has made the TV card
screw up in one stupid
way or another. I've tried emailing the BTTV
developer for *any* advice, or any experience of
such lock-ups, etc, but he never replied.<P>
So what can I do? Well, basically I can either
never use
my TV card until I'm able to buy parts for a second
(well, fourth...) system just to do TV capture, or
I can keep trying various settings to see if I can
ever make it <I>stop</I> hanging, whilst my FS
gets slowly corrupted.. Mmm, fun.<P>
Anyway, regarding your point again, my approach
doesn't really cut it for most people, especially the
most everyday computer users. The situation isn't
the fault of Linux or of Linux programmers, though,
it's down to the manufacturers- they supply disks
of drivers for windows, which AFAIK mostly
consist of the chipset manufacturer's drivers, plus
data to tell windows that this product is to be using
those drivers, or something along those lines.
Those that produce stuff that also works with Linux
could fairly easily indicate so on the packaging,
and <I>some</I> of them actually do, but most
don't, because they wouldn't be able to supply
some pretty installer program that would cover
up the details like they could for Windows.<P>
Oh, actually, perhaps they could. Oh I don't care,
it just sucks either way.

				Interesting.  Of all the hardware I own (which isn't much compared to most on this board) only two cards actually have manufacturer Linux support:  my generic 56k hardware modem, for which the support is limited to a sticker on the box saying "Supports Linux, Windows 95/98/Me, Windows NT/2000,. yadda yadda yadda" and my D-Link ethernet card, which actually came with the driver source on floppy and a README saying (in effect) "gcc rtl8139.c &amp;&amp; insmod 8139." I generally use the HOWTOs as first information source when installing new hardware, then if it doesn't work hit Google, and more or less expect the manufacturer's resources to be useless...  Not exactly "Aunt Tillie" friendly, is it?  But I expect the situation would be different if Linux was on 95% of desktops.<br>

And both are included with almost all linux distro's today.<BR><BR>If you're still living with XF86Config, you need to upgrade versions.

				Well Debian's current version isn't exactly ancient (I'm talking about the current version if you apt-get unstable, not the currently released stable version, which is 6-12 months behind due to rigorous testing).<BR><BR>But in any case, getting the tulip driver to work wasn't a problem.  But a newbie installing Linux has likely never heard of a tulip driver, and is unlikely to leap to the conclusion that his LinkSys network card needs it.  Auto-detecting it would be nice, or at least having the install say "you probably need either the tulip or the 8139".<BR><BR>As for X, i tried the new "XFree86 -configure" method, but it hung my computer (couldn't switch virtual consoles even; had to ssh in to kill it).  So I ended up manually configuring with xf86config.  The new config might be nice if it works, but I haven't had a chance to see it in action...

				There is too much resistence to change in the Linux community. The problem is a simple one: in the minds of Elitists, easier is not better, it's "lamer", "suckier", or "for wussies". Thus, when someone comes up with the brilliant idea that the average person should be able to actually <b>use</b> the system, they're booed off. Yet these boo-ers are the same people who bash the mass market for using Microsoft or Apple's OS X. OS X is astoundingly good... a simple, intuitive, appealing interface on top of loads of raw power. That's what Linux needs.<P>
Right now, when you install pretty much anybody's distro, you start up with an interface that has <b>tons and tons</b> of menus, icons, widgets, and whatnot, already up and running. It's an overload, and instead of trying to learn it, newbies are balking at it.<P>
So why not have an easy-to-use kernel configuration system? Why not have an independent object model, where any distribution or window manager can use each other's dialog pages?<P>
The only answer we seem to get is: "because it's <b>for wussies!</b>"

				The resistance to change is in all the wrong places. Kernel configuration really needs to be changed. Compare the effect of inserting an "autorun.inf" driver CD and "make xconfig" on a normal user. Yet Linux does change rapidly. The network system changes with every x in 2.x and drivers for 2.4.x don't work anymore in 2.4.x+y. Linux <i>is</i> hard to maintain as a single user machine if you expect all the bells and whistles of a modern system.

If it's quicker and more maintainable to write in a high-level language then why not just do the job - and use the time you saved compared to writing in C for other things?

				For people such as myself, it would mean that we now have to install Python on our systems - nothing major, just annoying.  I'm not thinking that using C would be the best option either, but it makes sense in that the kernel is written in C, those who develop the kernel are familiar with C, so C should probably be used for a utility that configures the kernel.

				<blockquote>I believe ESR got booed off for two reasons. One, the new config required Python.
</blockquote>

<p>

Yeah<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... we all know the kernel config process doesn't at any time rely on any language other than C.  For instance, we know that doing a "make xconfig" won't invoke Tcl/Tk, right?  Oh, wait...

<p>

Including a configuration option isn't a problem provided that it isn't the <b>only</b> configuration option.  Right now there are at least three ways of configuring the kernel ("config", "menuconfig", and "xconfig").  As long as the simplest method remains as a fallback, it should be okay to include another config method, even if it depends on Python.

				"make xconfig" depends on Tcl/Tk, but if you don't want or can't get Tcl/Tk on your system you can still "make menuconfig" on the console or an xterm. You can even "make config" if you don't have ncurses. Keeping the required development environment to a minimum is a laudible goal.

				No. I think everyone agrees that easier is better, but not everything is as easy as it wants to be. If a program can automatically configure a kernel for me that supports all the hardware and features I need, that's good, but I don't see much difference between a graphical menu and a text-based version of the same menu.

				&gt;Thus, when someone comes up with the brilliant <BR>&gt;idea that the average person should be able to <BR>&gt;actually use  the system, they're booed off. Yet <BR>&gt;these boo-ers are the same people who bash the <BR>&gt;mass market for using Microsoft or Apple's OS X. <BR><BR>Let's see.. When I started running Linux way back when I had to manually partition my hard drive, manually configure X (including plugging in video timings for my monitor), manually configure sound (including plugging in I/O addresses and IRQs), had to edit a config file in vi to add icons to my windowmanager (Afterstep Classic), had no real GUI filemanager, took 4 hours to figure out how to get my printer working properly, etc, etc.<BR><BR>Now, I can stick in a CD, have it autopartition, detect all my hardware, configure X, and has a full desktop environment with a GUI filemanager, where I can simply drag an icon to the panel.  I can hot plug USB and PCMCIA devices to my heart's content.  I can add new hardware, and it will detect and configure it on boot.  I can sit back and let my machine take care of keeping itself up to date with all the latest security patches.<BR><BR>I must have missed an AWFUL lot of booing somewhere. <BR><BR>&gt;Right now, when you install pretty much anybody's <BR>&gt;distro, <BR><BR>Except for Lindows, Lycoris, Libranet, OEOne, Xandros...<BR><BR>Come the release of Red Hat 8.0, you can probably add that to the list, given the focus they've put into creating a rational, consistent desktop in the betas.<BR><BR>&gt;you start up with an interface that has tons and &gt;tons  of menus, icons, widgets, and whatnot, <BR>&gt;already up and running. It's an overload, and <BR>&gt;instead of trying to learn it, newbies are <BR>&gt;balking at it.<BR><BR>Taken a look at Gnome lately?  From an end user perspective, all of the changes in Gnome 2.0 are aimed at usability, accessibility, simplification, and consistency.  To paraphrase Havoc, they're removing the "crack rock" features, and "proving one good way of doing things instead of six broken ones".<BR><BR>&gt;So why not have an easy-to-use kernel <BR>&gt;configuration system? <BR><BR>Noone has objected to the concept, only to the implementation.  At different points there were issues with the rulesets in CML2 differing from CML1 in ways that the developers didn't agree with.  The frontends used a different UI.  It globally loaded rules for all architectures.<BR><BR>It has long been Linus' policy not to accept patches which introduce more than one fundamental change.  The proper course would have been to make CML2 a drop in replacement for CML1, with no changes to the rulesets, and with front ends that completely emulated the old ones.  Then, and only then, discussions on rationalizing the rulesets and providing enhanced interfaces would be appropriate.<BR><BR>Did it solve the problem it set out to solve - i.e. providing a more flexible syntax and a single parsesr?  Sure, but it bundled too many other changes, and when you come down to it, it was replacing a system known to work with an unknown one.<BR><BR>On a side note, the whole topic is moot.  Does Windows provide you with an easy to use kernel configuration tool?  Does MacOS?  No, because the end user should NEVER have to configure a kernel.<BR><BR>&gt;Why not have an independent object model, where <BR>&gt;any distribution or window manager can use each <BR>&gt;other's dialog pages?<BR><BR>Umm... what on earth is that supposed to mean?<BR><BR>Matt

				That's because Redhat removed identification information from the "About" boxes of KDE applications. You can't blame the KDE guys for getting pissesd that they make this nice software, and the project doesn't get recognized for it. Sure its allowable by the GPL, but it isn't polite by any means. And there was no reason to do it. What did they think, that mentioning the KDE project could confuse users? ("But I thought I was running Redhat!") Come on. Take a look at common Windows apps like Yahoo messenger and AIM. They've got branding information all over them. Does it confuse users? I doubt it. People aren't that stupid.

				<i> There is too much resistence to change in the Linux community. The problem is a simple one: in the minds of Elitists, easier is not better, it's "lamer", "suckier", or "for wussies". </i>

<p>First, as other posters have said, there were valid reasons ESR's system was rejected. They weren't because it was for wussies.

<p>Second, configuring a kernel will never be easy. You have to make a lot of decisions that require technical knowledge. Whether you do that in a text-based interface or a fancy graphical one doesn't matter very much.

<p>The correct solution to make hardware configuration usable for the masses is not to make building a kernel easier but to make building a kernel unnecessary. The system has become more modular over time.[1] Hardware has become friendlier to autodetection. Distributions like RedHat come with a single kernel that will work for just about anyone. When you start up with new hardware, kudzu will recognize it, ask you about it, and load the appropriate driver.

<p>[1] and is still becoming more modular. 2.5 was supposed to completely remove the idea of compiled-in versions of stuff that is modular. I believe this got canned due to time constraints; look for it in 2.7 maybe.

<p>Okay, requiring less time, not less skill, seems like a reasonable goal. But also a completely different one than you gave in your first post.

<p>Again, average users don't need to recompile the kernel. Concessions to their lack of technical expertise would be ineffective and unnecessary.

<p> <i>It is almost as important to lower the barrier of entry for kernel hacking, which is very important for Linux's vitality. And speaking of that, I haven't been able to get a decent patch since they implemented bitkeeper for the kernel. What's up with that?</i>

<p>That wouldn't lower the barrier of entry for kernel hacking. Programming the kernel is hard and becoming more so as the system becomes more complex (with more granular locking, etc). The difficulty of running menuconfig is nothing compared to dealing with those issues.

<p>Second, I'm happy with kernel hackers being an elite group. That's totally different than <i>Linux users</i> being an elite group, which I don't feel is true and am glad for. If kernel hackers were not an elite group, I believe code quality would suffer.

<p> <i>And speaking of that, I haven't been able to get a decent patch since they implemented bitkeeper for the kernel. What's up with that?</i>

<p>Don't know. You'd have to give more specifics...

				There are dozens of excellent programmers who use Linux, but don't hack the kernel.  Lowering the barrier in general will allow them to work on the kernel if they feel like it, without lowering the quality of work on the kernel.<BR><BR>Not to mention that, even if 1000 crappy programmers submitted crappy patches to the respective maintainers, they simply wouldn't get the patches included.  We don't need to make it difficult for them just so we don't have to write 2 or 3 more replies("Rejected.  Code quality sucks." is all that's required) every day.

				there is a big difference between the kernel and the desktop application of the kernel underneath it. i think that change in the kernel should come slowly, after every element has been thought and rethought of. if the kernel breaks, so will the systems built on it. if there is any doubt, PLEASE don't change the underlying structure. it is the same with murder cases.<BR><BR>i do agree that sometimes, the resistance to change in the kernel transfers over to the other elements of the system, but you should bring up that point NOT to kernel developers but the others. the average user should not be compiling kernels every day. those who do it should know what is going on. abstraction is good, but autodetection on the kernel level is NOT good, for example, because this should happen when u install the distribution, NOT the underlying system.<BR>

				<blockquote>The only answer we seem to get is: "because it's for wussies!"</blockquote>

<p>Do you have any evidence for this statement?  All these discussions (including the discussion over whether or not to include Raymond's configuration system in the kernel) have taken place  on public, searchable forums, so if your claim is true then you should be able to produce tons of evidence. (<A HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=CML2&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=group%3Dfa.linux.kernel">Here's a start.</A> [google.com])</p>

<p>My memory of the discussion on lkml was that people had a lot of different problems with CML2, which might or might not have been showstoppers.  But I don't remember anyone saying "no, this would make kernel configuration too easy for novices, and we don't want that."</p>

<p>If you accept the premise that "Open Source" development is a magic process for the effortless production of arbitrary amounts of excellent code, or if you assume that it is obvious how to create good user interfaces, then I suppose the only reasonable explanation for a lack of user-friendliness is a conspiracy on the part of developers.  Absent those premises, you're free to adopt a more reasonable explanation: writing easy-to-use software is much, much harder than it appears, developers have limited resources, and we just haven't gotten a lot of things right yet.</p>

				You're absolutely right about this - let's say - "OSS paradox". There's a great need for simplicity and unity in the GUI-corner of the complex GNU/Linux-world. KDE and Gnome are two very nice user environments right now, but if GNU/Linux is supposed to attract - for instance - my dad or mother, the system must be built upon a more monolithic structure and philosophy of development. - But that's the diametrical opposite of the original Linux-/OSS-model (the bazaar), which attracts us. Those who're really into computers and dig the shell and compiler all day.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

That's also why Linux is never going to rule the desktop. If Mac OS X got ported to i386, they really could attract a lot of users. But then again, Microsoft would stop porting their programs to the OS. As I see it right now, Mac OS is the only really alternative for average users when looking at OS'es for the desktop. 

As long as I may dig my Blackbox, I don't care about the rest.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

				Good comment.  Easy is perceived as bad.  Yes, some easy things (Microsoft Bob) are really bad, and some difficult things are good, but Linux, like Unix in general (sorry to generalize but it's a cultural inheritance), suffers from an "old boys' club" mentality in which earned knowledge of arcana is viewed as an entry point.  Sort of like morse code has been to ham radio -- there aren't rational reasons to require it any more (though some of us actually like to use it, sportingly), but removing the requirement brings out all sorts of anger from old timers who had to learn it.<BR><BR>Where it currently bugs me the most:  Gentoo looks like a swell distro.  Installing from source ends dependency hell and optimizes performance; I can buy it.  But the setup is dreadful, basically more Linux From Scratch than anything else.  The topic of an installer came up on Gentoo Forums.  The "consensus" of the Gentoo user base is that "Gentoo is a hard distribution, and so the installation should be hard too."  What rot!  Once installed, no distribution should be gratuitously hard to live with. And while Gentoo lacks some of the GUI tools of say Mandrake or Red Hat, it's basically a clean system that shouldn't be that hard to manage.  But the install procedure basically consists of printing out a lengthy set of instructions and doing a lot of hand edits of files, step by step, and hoping your system is enough like the developers' to work right.<BR><BR>Personally I don't find the current kernel config (make xconfig) to be that hard, just a little nerve-racking where some new options show up that I don't understand.  Which is what Bruce set out to fix.  We can quibble about implementation details but his heart's in the right place.  Linux won't prosper so long as it lives with the old boys' mentality.  If I want to join the Freemasons, I will.

Nothing, however, is stopping you from implementing a Gentoo based distribution with ease of use and usability in mind.

<p>
Moreover, it's not like complete newbies are going to be doing kernel compiles.  For anyone with enough experience to recompile the kernel, an ncurses-based system is adequate IMHO.

But I for one would welcome a better GUI than make xconfig, which I find pretty honkey. Since when are more options bad? It's not like they are forcing you into switching.

				Congratualtions. Thats the largest pile of bullshit I've read in a long while. The GUI isn't being forced on anyone. If you want to sit at a console all day, go ahead. No one's stopping you. The GUI is an option. The point I was making to the previous poster was that just becuase he doesn't want/use/like it, doesn't mean that everyone else feels the same. It's all about choice, the whole reason Linux exists in the first place. Linux will never become GUI only configuration, by virtue of the fact that many of the systems it runs on are incapable of using said GUI.

				Linux kernel developers often times act like schoolyard bullies.
<p>
This is a pretty strong statement, and needs to be qualified.  The Linux kernel developers are a very talented group of programmers that have written some impressive code which is helping stop the Microsoft machine control all of computing.  
<p>
These programmers are doing professional-quality work, oftentimes on a completely volunteer basis.
<p>
We have lost a lot of good code which the kernel could have used because of some of the bullying that the kernel developers have engaged in.  The lost of Eric's excellent CML2 is the most highlighted case, but <A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/7786/">we also lost a lot of improvments to the ugly IDE subsystem</A> [lwn.net].  The IDE developer finally <A HREF="http://www.lib.uaa.alaska.edu/linux-kernel/archive/2002-Week-31/1637.html">had enough</A> [alaska.edu] of the schoolyard bullying games; and so Linux lost another developer.
<p>
I wonder how long Linus Torvalds will allow his "inside circle" to continue to mock and belittle attempts to improve the kernel code.  If these actions continue, the kernel code will languish and become more unstable.  Is Linus even considering adding <A HREF="http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/pthreads/">next generation pthreads</A> [ibm.com] to the kernel?  I <em>really</em> want to see the Linux kernel become a real competitor to Solaris and AIX in the enterprise, so I hope that Linus fires some of the more nasty bullies from kernel development (I don't care how good Viro's code is; he comes off as being one of the bigger flamers) so that new ideas are truly welcome in to the kernel again.
<P>

The people you call schoolyard bullies are the people who have done the most to make the kernel the great piece of code that it is.  Linus is an amazing manager of code and people .    What Linus did in both cases (CML2/ESR and IDE/Dalecki) was actually good management.  Marcin said he had enough because people kept complaining that the IDE code was unstable but Linus supported him for as long as he produced good and promising code.  When Marcin gave up,  Linus went back to what was stable.  Nobody else really knew how Marcin Dalecki's new code worked and it still had bugs so Linus made the smartest move: go back to crufty but stable and known code that works.  Linus (and Linux) can not afford to have core maintainer's who are not tough with "thick hides" and "stiff backbones" who sometimes look like "bully's" because if a maintainer gives up on a project, that part of the kernel may "bit rot", and truly become unusable.  Linus plays the game of "survival of the fittest" in both code and developers.  If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.  When Marcin closed up shop, Linus did not ask "please someone take this promising code I put in of Marcin's and make it work right" or say Marcin please dont go!.  Instead he said "fine" and went back to what worked.  If someone wants to take over Marcins work and make it work right, Linus might put it back in but Linus is not looking for ideals or promising code; he is looking for results.  The case of ESR is different but similar.  ESR made a lot of changes (that not everybody was happy with) with a lot of promise but he had had enough and gave up as well.  Now there is someone else at the mantle of configuration (writing far less controversial code) and hopefully STRONG enough to take the heat.  Linus knows that no one person or piece of code is vital to the whole.  If  something really needs to be fixed, he knows that someone will come along and eventually do it but he has no patience for what should or could or want in kernel development.  The schoolyard bullies work hard to weed out the best code from contributors and send them on to Linus and despite people like you giving them a hard time, they have proven that they are tough enough to take it and keep on producing while ESR and Marcin Dalecki proved they werent.  Thank goodness Linus has no tolerance for weak code or people.

				Are you people actually READING anything about these topics or just spouting off based on a few summaries you read somewhere?  There are several messages like this here and I have to wonder how you have developed the leg strength to be able to jump to these kinds of conclusions.
<p>
True, some of the developers can be caustic, but I don't think it's unreasonable for people to be adults about things.  If you can't handle criticism you should go develop for a nursery school or something.  The kernel developers are not babysitters.  They don't have time to hold your hand, and encourage you, and give you applause and little paper prizes every time you do something right.
<p>
There were many good and valid objections to ESR's system.  Not all of them were, but many were.  The largest objection (iirc) was to his attitude.  Particularly when it looked like things weren't going to go his way.
<p>
The IDE system issues were even more complex.  Marcin was working hard to clean it up, but his changes often reached into other areas, and had consequences outside of the ide area.  Some of the changes broke functionality some people depended on.  Obviously, these people were upset.  More than that, his changes made running 2.5 on an ide system risky.  That, I think, was what got him the most negative feedback.  Especially when he wrote it off as the cost of improvments.  
<p>
A broken ide subsystem made it difficult for many developers to work on and test the 2.5 kernel.  Which, in turn, delayed improvements to other subsystems and completion of other projects.
<p>
Was this Marcin's fault?  Probably not.  In general they probably would've been better off setting up a "new" ide tree like they're doing now before.  Regardless, eventually he had enough.
It's very sad that all of his hard work has now had to be removed from the kernel.  It is a shame that it's going to go to waste.  However, I don't think you can say the problem was just a bunch of schoolyard bullies knocking a newcomer.  That was not the case at all.
<p>
In other areas we have things like the new kbuild that was written by Keith Owens.  This is a really nice system, it still hasn't gone in.  (Amazingly, it was left out of this post, though I'd count it as far more likely to get in than CML2.)  The only 
real contention here is that keith wants a flag-day change, and linus wants it in pieces. It'll (hopefully) eventually all get in, as it is being chopped up and added in in pieces, though how it'll ever make it completely this way without something akin to a FDC is beyond me.  (Doesn't mean it's not possible, I just don't see how).  
<p>
All of these things are real issues that are brought up.  Nobody is rejecting patches or ideas because they come from an unknown.  Nobody is rejecting ideas because they don't like the way the person looks/smells/types their sig or any other superficial reasons.  
<p>
The only objections I've seen have been related to the code/idea at hand.  This is perfectly valid, and it's how we avoid crap getting into the kernel because of some namby pamby desire to avoid offending people.
<p>
This is the big bad world.  It's full of adults.  
Some ideas are bad.  Some code is bad.  Everyone makes mistakes, and not everyone is nice.  There's no naptime, and there's no milk and cookies.
<p>
Suck it up and cope.

<p>
I don't know that I could tell you what broke down, or even if it was avoidable.  IMO, I think they just weren't thinking in terms of migrating to a totally new system.  I think it took Marcin's demonstrating how bad the existing ide layer was by breaking it so severely trying to fix it to bring people to think that we needed a new tree for ide.  Will it happen again?  I would have to say yes.  Some things we can't see until we've gone down the road a bit.  More than that, we're all human.  Everyone makes mistakes.
<p>
<i>Not having time to be polite is a laughable excuse for people who have the spare time to write an operating system kernel.</i>
<p>
I never said they weren't polite.  Nor did I say they didn't have time to be polite.  What I said was that they didn't have time to rewrite their email a hundred times trying to find the best way to say something that won't offend everyone.
<p>
Are you always courteous and polite with everyone you know?  Your friends and confidants?  Your cow-orkers?  To some extent yes, but I would guess you don't feel like you have to go out of your way to avoid offending them.
<p>
I think it's the same for developers.  If you are here, then it's because you are ready to participate.  If you can't stand the heat get out of hte kitchen.  Can't run with the big dogs stay on the porch.  (Add your infinate cliche's here)  <p>

I'm not saying things never get out of hand.  I'm not saying there are never flames, or that nobody weighs in with an ad hominem attack.  But it certainly isn't the norm for the group, as it would seem to be from some of the posts in this forum.

				<blockquote> <i>The Linux kernel developers are a very talented group of programmers that have written some impressive code which is helping stop the Microsoft machine control all of computing.</i> </blockquote>
<p>It's funny you should say that, because that's completely unrelated to the reason Linux was designed for in the first place...
<p>Linux was designed to replace the non-free Unix on the larger, expensive machines at the Universities. It was basically Free Unix for PCs. It just so happens that people have extended it in the meantime to be used to replace things like the Microsoft desktop, but Linux is definately not competing for the Microsoft space, or the desktop... Microsoft, on the other hand, is competing for OUR space.

				<i>Is Linus even considering adding next generation pthreads to the kernel?</i>

<p>Regardless of your points being valid or not, this specific example/question is wrong, since support for NGPT has been in the kernel since 2.5.8 (mantained by Linus), as you can read on the NGPT devel <A HREF="http://www-124.ibm.com/pipermail/pthreads-devel/2002-August/000197.html">mailing list</A> [ibm.com] (see the bits about 2.5.x). 

<p>About 2.4.x: the official mantainer is not Linus, but Marcelo Tosatti, and he has the precise mandate to keep 2.4.x <b>stable</b>, so I doubt he will include the support for NGPT (but I could be wrong, of course).

				(well, the site is still<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/.ed, so I'm winging it here...)
<p>
Hopefully the tool(s) in question are flexible enough that they can be
adapted/generalised for other systems (i.e. other than the linux kernel).
<p>
Configuring complex systems (openoffice, mozilla, KDE, Gnome, etc.) that have to run on numerous platforms and can contain optional elements that can depend on other optional elements (or be mutually exclusive with them) is always a challenge.  It would be a big saving if one tool(set) could be applied to lots of these large projects.  This is a lot like autoconf replacing weird project-specific configurators.
<p>
Equally (and perhaps complicating the above goal) the tool in question really needs to be powererful enough in a particular instanciation that it's "complete" - i.e that one doesn't need to manually fix stuff up (in the config output file) to get some of the more advanced options.  Windriver's VxWorks, for example, has a cool little kernel-image configuration program - but this always seems to lack GUI access to the one component I need - so one gets used to the raw config file, and the power of the GUI tool is lost.

				Maybe in the future, when we are installing packages (from source with our new wizzbang processors) When we select a package we can open up a configuration tree and decide what we want in each piece of software. The list of conflicts would be impressive to see (unless we also improve intuitiveness of options) but X would still need it's own special configuration. (and Mozilla)

				Configurators like this are always called new, but they are just more of the same. Did everybody miss the Kernel Configurator in KDE3? Go dig in your Control Panel a little more. At least the KDE configurator is mouse clickable, and has decent (Not the Greatest) descriptions. I would like to see few as possible configurators come with the Linux Kernel by default. I say keep the custom configurators as optional add-ons and the like. As for me, make menuconfig.

				After finally being able to get the page, I think that it is a great start and a tremendous improvement over Xconfig.<BR><BR>That said, I think he still needs to go further. Most users don't have a clue what all the options are or mean. Even with the descriptions and recommendations they will quickly become overwelmed.<BR><BR>I feel that users should be presented with a very basic and lean initial configuration screen. One that lists generic features for them to enable and disable. For example a single check box for IDE and SCSI HD support or a single checkbox to enable HAM radio support with generic or "standard" options preselected for those devices. Then there should be an advanced button that brings them to the complete configuration options, such as Roman's example.<BR><BR>This, combined with some form of modprobe hardware detection, would make kernel configuration a breeze, even for MCSEs. Also, the fact that this configurator reads the existing config, rather than starting with a blank slate everytime, is great!!

				ESR got himself booed off the stage by trying to undermine the process.  His solution was technically superior in ways, it didn't do what Linus and others wanted and he was playing politics and games trying to get it in to the kernel.  When that was exposed it was done.  Technically superior or not, the games undermine everything, it's a very open process and they like peer review and things done in the open.  Bottom line, not too many people aren't replacable and any work you do can probably be done by somebody else, they don't need politicians.  There were a few times when Linus made it very clear what he wanted changed and ESR simply didn't fix it, it was as if he didn't even hear it;  look at the threads in the kernel archive. I don't know what ESR's motivation was but he made it look a little corrupt.
<p>
Further, people are working on the configuartion language but there are bigger problems to be solved, everyone knows it and still the efforts don't fully address them.  Like how do you know the configuation options used on the kernel you are running?  There is no reason to change just for the sake of change and compilation speed isn't a huge issue, my dual amd compiles kernels so fast I don't care if I cut the speed in half.  Plus, when you're hacking you usually work on a module or two and don't rebuild the whole thing.
<p>
The process is good, they don't take crap.  The VM system and the IDE system are other prime examples.  Al Viro is kind of mean to people but everyone else makes it pretty clear what needs to be done, why things aren't accpeted, even Al has expectations that he makes clear.  There are expectations for robustness, it's more important than performance.  Hans Reiser has had issues with that, he can't explain the robustness or answers concerns but he can point to benchmarks; clue: they don't give a shit if it's not robust.  
<p>
There have been a handful of people who just don't cut it.  Believe me, they can be replaced.  It sucks, it'll be a dark day when Alan Cox or Dave Miller quit, if they ever do but they also know the rules, they play by them and they have their own forks if they don't agree.  If Linus or someone else don't like your code, it doesn't get in, fork and show that they are wrong or make it better.  This isn't bullying or anything like that,  it's not that they are elitests, they have real expectations that aren't meet some times.    Are some people and some parts of the kernel more equal than others?  Of course, we're all human.  
<p>
I take exception to the suggestion that the kernel team is throwing out great stuff for non technical reasons.  They aren't they throw it out because it doesn't do what it is supposed to, people are trying to get it in for non-technical reasons with non-technical means or because it's not robust.  It's not easy to write a VM or IDE system, there are a ton of expectations, it's a hard job, there are working solutions already that you have to do better than.

				In particular, a new configuration system has to be able to run on rules that the old configuration system can run on, so that both can be in the kernel until people are satisfied with the new one (ironic that Linus rejected CML2 for largely this reason, but then didn't follow this principal with IDE, where it would have been much easier). In order to replace something that everyone has to use, you have to replace it with something that just works for everybody, including the people writing rules, people who want to keep their old configs, people who want to maintain code for both the new kernels and old kernels, and so forth. The whole "Aunt Tillie" thing really is an issue, because important kernel developers don't want to spend more thought on configuring the kernel they're building than Aunt Tillie would, and they already have routine ways of doing that.<BR><BR>"Technical superiority" is a subjective thing, and "does it configure the kernel" is not the only factor. At least as important is "is switching to it easier than continuing to use the existing tools".<BR><BR>Incidentally, the problem with the old build system was not that it was too slow to build but that, if you changes a few things and rebuilt, either you did a complete rebuild, which was too slow, or you just rebuilt the module you were working on, which didn't necessarily catch all of the changes. The new versions are moving toward giving you the ability to rebuild only those things which actually need to be rebuilt without making you know what things these are. People frequently report problems where they've forgotten to do the right thing after they've changed something.<BR><BR>Making the current kernel's configuration available isn't actually difficult at all; it's just that userspace generally has the information anyway (most people copy the config file somewhere parallel to the kernel image). The hard thing is configuring a new kernel version to match the effects of the config file for an old kernel version: sometimes the options change, sometimes there are new options required for old things, etc.

<p>

This one should be so simple to solve that I don't understand why it's an issue at all, namely: include a copy of the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.config file in the kernel image and add a handler so that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/proc/kconfig maps to it.  On my system, the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.config file is 36k in size -- small compared with the size of most running kernels these days.

<p>

Obviously that should be another configuration option, but it would certainly solve most of the problem, if not all of it.

				Kernel changes that modularize everything that can be (pretty much that way now) and everything loaded on need (it's done that way now too mostly).  So why compile your kernel (besides the because you can thing).  One thing I would like is to see a standard way for non GPL'd drivers to be added to the kernel without a recompile, or having to half way compile (proprietary core) with a kernel interface needing compiled.  It's kind of that way with some, but only if your binary is developed against the same kernel (the LTMODEM drivers used to be and may be still this way).  Microsoft does not write all of their drivers.  We should not have to either.  Seems to me this would sure make alot more hardware work under Linux!  I know the GNU bigots won't like it much, but I just want to be able to have more stuff supported out of the box then I do now.

				Custom kernels are necessary because Linux is a monolithic kernel. That means that in order to use certain hardware or other features, the drivers have to reside in the kernel itself.<BR><BR>Now, lets suppose that you just got the latest gee wiz device and you want to use it on your Linux box. You hook your "flux capacitor" up to the firewire port and nothing happens. Why, because either a firewire or a flux capacitor driver (or both) is required and the kernel doesn't have it installed. This means that you must rebuild the kernel with the appropriate driver in order for your new flux capacitor to work.<BR><BR>Now, some may argue that the kernels should be pre-built with all the drivers and everything. Indeed, many distros do something like this for their stock kernels. But that still doesn't account for hardware that is yet to be invented. It also causes the kernel to grow into a giant that gives the term monolithic a whole new meaning. This large size means slow boot times and slower overall performance, in some cases. Surely, you don't want that?<BR><BR>Indeed, many people want to trim the size of their kernel to an absolute minimum to improve the performance of their system, not to mention the security enhancement of removing unneccessary services. Do you really need HAM radio support? Most people don't, so why would most people want the HAM drivers loaded in their kernel? Do you need NTFS file system support, as I do? Probably not, especially with write access, so why include it? But at the same time, why prevent me from using it, as I need to?<BR><BR>Even without the above reasons requiring the custom kernel, there is one more reason in favor of it. Part of the whole idea behind Linux is the ability to modify and customize it to your heart's content. That means if you want to modify your kernel you can. And this project will make such modifications easier than in the past. If you don't want to bother with customizing your kernel, then use the latest stock kernel from a major distribution, which will have mostly everything included. But, if it is slow or your flux capacitor isn't supported, you'll just have to wait and hope that the distro includes the support in its next release.

				Mostly correct; but the kernel is not necessarily monolithic.  It CAN be; but every distribution I've used comes with a modular kernel, with most options compiled as modules which are loaded and unloaded as needed.  This is also how most people compile their kernels.  It is very possible to compile them monolithically;  but then you're guaranteeing that you'll need a recompile with any hardware changes.

				<BR>Er, the term "monolithic," when used in references to kernels, has nothing to do with loadable modules.

				Well even if all the drivers are modular (a good thing!) your still left with am I a server or am I a workstation options. Descktop kernels require a quick response(10 milliseconds tops) but this may reduce the performance under server type coditions were a few hunderd millisecond responce is good enough.

				As an end user I have had no trouble with Linux device drivers. I suspect that most users with standard machines will have no trouble with device drivers. I use Debian. It compiles many drivers into the kernel directly. It includes the rest as modules. The list of hardware that a default Debian does not run on is pretty small.<BR><BR>I do however use a custom kernel. Not because I have to, but because I want to. In the case of Debian I wish to use devfs which is experimental. I also wish to remove the unneeded drivers, modularize other drivers, and compile the kernel specifically for the target CPU.<BR><BR>If you must recompile your kernel it is the fault of your distrobution not the Linux kernel.<BR><BR><em>Is the Linux device driver model really flawed as many claim?</em><BR><BR>I take exception to your statement that "many claim." It makes you look like a troll. If you wrote "some claim" I would accept that. Regardless, I disagree. From a technology perspective Linux device drivers can do anything that "that other OS" kernel can. The big difference is that linux drivers don't usually come precompiled. There is no good reason for this other then history.<BR>

However I do know that many linux device drivers, such as the OpenAFS client file system module, rely on knowing the exact offsets of fields in the task_struct.  There is no run-time method of retrieving these offsets as far as I know.  So our administrators are forced to re-compile the openafs module everytime they apply a patch, or run a different kernel on a system that has changed the layout of task_struct.  When maintaining systems that may serve different purposes, I can see why this would be an administration headache.  We use a distributed filesystem where most binaries, such as device drivers, are maintained on a central server instead of being on each local box.  <BR>

				I'm sorry, but tinkering around with another graphical configuration app isn't going to fix the fundamental problems with Linux kernel configuration.  (In fact, if anything, I find a single window application with a tree widget worse than xconfig.)
<p>
We shouldn't have to decide for hundreds of packages whether we want them or what options they should be pre-configured with in the first place.  Almost everything should always be dynamically loadable and should always be dynamically loaded.  Modules should be independent between minor kernel versions.  There should be very few options, and those that are there should be configurable at runtime.  The few remaining compile-time options shouldn't require some complicated interface.  If we want single-file kernel distribution, we should be able to create a single file archive of the kernel and the required modules in a way that the bootstrap loader understands.
<p>
While parts of the Linux kernel are great--the variety of kernels and file systems, for example--I think overall kernel architecture and configuration is by far the weakest part of the Linux operating system.  It's not the GUI that inhibits Linux adoption by the masses--Linux GUIs are up to par with other platforms--it's the fact that a large number of people end up having to recompile the kernel to get things like audio, FireWire, power management, cameras, and USB working, even with the modularized kernels in some distributions.

<p>
Yes, kernel modules work better on Windows and Macintosh OS X.  That's the kind of kernel configurability Linux should aim for.
<p>
<i>That, my friend, is a result of the true error in the whole picture: there is no consistency. People are doing what they think is right, but there is no big, guideline which will bring the whole system to a certain level because it's all worked out. </i>
<p>
Windows and Macintosh had to make dynamic kernel configuration work because recompilation just wasn't an option in their markets.
<p>
Your analogy to GUIs misses the point.  Hardware vendors on Windows or Macintosh don't make their drivers work because of some consistent guidelines, they make they work because otherwise they couldn't sell their products.  Hardware vendors did this long before DOS/Windows even had a kernel or guidelines.  Linux kernel configuration is, if anything, more consistent and standardized than Windows, it just happens to be more cumbersome for end users, too.

				What a crock.  It'll be a sad day for linux when you can't customize your kernel.  I don't WANT all the freaking modules for every piece of hardware the kernel supports.  That's just ridiculous.  I only actually USE a very small percentage.  Are you going to suggest that the same kernel be bootable across all architectures too?  Or maybe we should just always have to have a kernel and a copy of the full binary module tree for every possible hardware platform the kernel supports?  
<p>
Sheesh.  It's people like you that give laziness a bad name.

				<i>Or maybe we should just always have to have a kernel and a copy of the full binary module tree for every possible hardware platform the kernel supports?</i>

We should do what we do with every other piece of software on Linux: have separate packages.  You have a GeeWhiz audio card?  Install the GeeWhiz audio package.  Want ReiserFS?  Install the ReiserFS package.  Want networking?  Install the networking package.  Kernel modules are a start, but they need a lot more work. 
<p>
<i>It'll be a sad day for linux when you can't customize your kernel.</i>
<p>
I do want to be able to customize the kernel.  In fact, I want to be able to do so much more and much more easily than I can now.  I want to be able to add functionality to the kernel as easily as I can add a new command line command.  We stopped recompiling our command line interpreters to add new commands some time in the 1960's--and Linux should stop requiring recompiling the kernel to add new functionality.
<p>
<i>Sheesh. It's people like you that give laziness a bad name.</i>

				xconfig is good enough for me. The problem is that dependencies between drivers aren't tracked (at least not well) so it is easy to turn on an option and break your kernel. Solve THAT problem and you win a cookie; Fail to solve it and you're just painting pretty pictures.
<P>
In addition, requiring the Qt or GTK libraries is ridiculous. I don't want to link to anything that large. If you can't get it done with Xaw (or something similarly small) I'm not interested in your stupid config tool. I'd rather use something fast and ncurses-based.

				Ummmm......the linux kernel _IS_ modular if you compile everything as modules.  What do you think many distributions like redhat or mandrake are doing?  You can quite successfully use their percompiled kernels on almost any system.<BR> <BR>

The whole point of kernel configuration is that you can actually not compile what you don't need and you can make a kernel perfectly suited to your system.  Without modules if you don't have a reason for them.  If you never change anything, why would you need to have module supporting sitting around in your kernel?

				I'll second this.  I have no problem using 'make menuconfig', its intuitive, the help is ususally helpful, it works over a remote connection, etc.  Now if we were still stuck with the 'make config' and saying Y/N over and over again, then realizing that you meant to say Y and not N three questions ago, hitting ^C, starting over, and repeating this process, then that would be an entirely different story.
