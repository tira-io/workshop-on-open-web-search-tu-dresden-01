&lt;TTimo&gt; back!
&lt;TTimo&gt; the trunk is fairly experimental
&lt;Primer&gt; well. 1-1 isn't working well for me
&lt;TTimo&gt; I'm not sure that's what you would want to build ..
&lt;TTimo&gt; you should try building from the Alpha branch
&lt;Primer&gt; I have this issue where I create a brush, the drag a side, and it's DOG SLOW
&lt;TTimo&gt; that's the current stable release
&lt;TTimo&gt; mh .. did you try loading a texture set?
&lt;Primer&gt; and it hangs my X while it moves the side one square every 5 seconds
&lt;Primer&gt; yes
&lt;Primer&gt; I can load textures just fine
&lt;TTimo&gt; I remember it did that when you were using the default texture
  JOIN  Juz!<A HREF="mailto:juz@ppp-4-13.5800-3.access.uk.worldonline.com">juz@ppp-4-13.5800-3.access.uk.worldonline.com</A>
  MODE  &quot;+o Juz&quot; by ChanServ!<A HREF="mailto:ChanServ@Chanserv.telefragged.com">ChanServ@Chanserv.telefragged.com</A>
&lt;TTimo&gt; if you load a texture set and set the current texture to something it didn't happen
&lt;Primer&gt; hrmm
&lt;Primer&gt; I could swear that I did that and I continued to have the issue...
&lt;Primer&gt; is the linux tree comparable to the windows tree in terms of features, stability?
&lt;Primer&gt; are they in sync?
&lt;TTimo&gt; yes
&lt;Primer&gt; ok
&lt;Primer&gt; hrmm
&lt;TTimo&gt; maybe a few tweaks to apply on linux for Alpha branch
&lt;TTimo&gt; (cause I've been working on win32 Alpha yesterday)
&lt;TTimo&gt; but we release stuff in sync anyway
&lt;Primer&gt; the latest nvidia driver has been quite stable for all my 3d stuff
&lt;Primer&gt; for example, Maya runs VERY well
&lt;TTimo&gt; well
&lt;TTimo&gt; I have NVidia hardware too
&lt;TTimo&gt; and Radiant works great
&lt;Primer&gt; in Linux?
&lt;TTimo&gt; yes
&lt;Primer&gt; what distro?
&lt;TTimo&gt; Debian
&lt;Primer&gt; of course
&lt;TTimo&gt; heh :)
&lt;Primer&gt; I use redhate 7.1
&lt;TTimo&gt; mh
&lt;TTimo&gt; 7.1 ? that's tad old
&lt;TTimo&gt; err actually .. I was thinking about mandrake
&lt;Primer&gt; yeah, 7.1 is latest redhate
&lt;Primer&gt; <A HREF="http://sh.nu/mon/radiant.jpg">http://sh.nu/mon/radiant.jpg</A>
&lt;Primer&gt; check that out
&lt;Primer&gt; I have twinview
&lt;TTimo&gt; ah
&lt;TTimo&gt; maybe that's a problem with dual head systems then
&lt;Primer&gt; I dunno
&lt;TTimo&gt; what is your setup to have two monitors? you have two X displays?
&lt;Primer&gt; twinview card
&lt;TTimo&gt; or localhost:0.0 localhost:0.1 ?
&lt;Primer&gt; nvidia dual head card
&lt;Primer&gt; no
&lt;Primer&gt; it's one card
&lt;TTimo&gt; ah ok
&lt;Primer&gt; 2 rgb 15 outputs
&lt;Primer&gt; it's treated as if it were one card
&lt;Primer&gt; <A HREF="http://sh.nu/mon/head-001.jpg">http://sh.nu/mon/head-001.jpg</A>
&lt;TTimo&gt; so it's like a desktop with a wiiide resolution
&lt;TTimo&gt; I didn't know nvidia sold that
&lt;Primer&gt; they've had this for quite a while now
&lt;TTimo&gt; heh .. that your kid :)
&lt;Primer&gt; this is a geforce 2 mx with twinview
&lt;Primer&gt; winfast leadtek geforce 2 mx dh pro
&lt;Primer&gt; is the make/model
&lt;TTimo&gt; well .. it's not a &quot;very&quot; standard setup, so I would think that's the problem
&lt;Primer&gt; you gonna be here for a while? what time is it there?
&lt;TTimo&gt; did all versions of Radiant have the problem with this setup?
&lt;Primer&gt; yes
&lt;Primer&gt; abut I had this same problem on my old gf1 ddr
&lt;Primer&gt; same EXACT problem
&lt;TTimo&gt; so, the ones you downloaded as binary and the ones you compiled
&lt;Primer&gt; yes
&lt;Primer&gt; and on the old card too
&lt;Primer&gt; the old card was a single head
&lt;TTimo&gt; mh .. I don't think I would be able to reproduce the problem .. I have single head gf1 and it's been working great ..
&lt;Primer&gt; ok, let me test now
&lt;TTimo&gt; you would have to build it and try to track down the performance hit
&lt;Primer&gt; I quit q3
&lt;Primer&gt; 1-1TA?
&lt;TTimo&gt; yeah that's the latest stab;e
&lt;TTimo&gt; stable even
&lt;Primer&gt; btw, the instructions for downloading the source from cvs...
&lt;Primer&gt; says that I need to get Alpha GtkRadint for 1-1, and just GtkRadiant dor 1.2
&lt;Primer&gt; I believe this is...backwards?
&lt;TTimo&gt; no no
&lt;TTimo&gt; the stable version is on a branch
&lt;TTimo&gt; and the experimental one is in the trunk
&lt;Primer&gt; ok, that textures thing...no go
&lt;TTimo&gt; cause the main developement work is supposed to be happening on 1.2 now
&lt;Primer&gt; maybe I should nuke my ~/.q3as/radiant?
&lt;TTimo&gt; that may be a good idea
&lt;Primer&gt; damn, it just hangs
&lt;Primer&gt; I sometimes have to wait literally minutes before I get a response from the app
&lt;TTimo&gt; err
&lt;TTimo&gt; you should definitely compile a debug build and try to find out where it's hanging
&lt;Primer&gt; I'm gonna re-install 1-1
&lt;Primer&gt; heh
&lt;Primer&gt; I'm not much of a coder
&lt;TTimo&gt; mh
&lt;TTimo&gt; well I could get you some debug builds and stuff I guess
&lt;Primer&gt; I knew enough to add -I../incude to the Makefile though :)
&lt;Primer&gt; err
&lt;Primer&gt; -I../include
&lt;Primer&gt; well, I'm willing to compile it
&lt;Primer&gt; if you give me a few pointers
  NICK  MarsSleep is now known as MarsMattel
&lt;TTimo&gt; I need to work some on current Alpha
&lt;TTimo&gt; and make sure it's building
&lt;Primer&gt; well, I jkust built it
&lt;Primer&gt; it builds
&lt;Primer&gt; :P
&lt;TTimo&gt; mh ok .. that means it wasn't too bad
&lt;Primer&gt; so, cvs co Alpha GtkRadiant?
&lt;Primer&gt; and that will get me 1-1TA?
&lt;TTimo&gt; cvs co -r Alpha GtkRadiant
&lt;Primer&gt; ok
&lt;TTimo&gt; that will get you .. 1.1-TA.1
&lt;TTimo&gt; i.e. a bugfix build of 1.1-TA we are preparing
&lt;Primer&gt; ok
&lt;Primer&gt; pulling it down now
&lt;TTimo&gt; I'll open a bug report on bugzilla about it
&lt;Primer&gt; is it simply a matter of setting a debug flag in the Makefile?
