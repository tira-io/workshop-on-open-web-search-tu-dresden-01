The cost savings is calculated by taking the retail price of the books with NO shipping, and comparing it to the best price BIGWORDS.com could find, WITH shipping. As you can see, we could have shown even greater savings by adding shipping to the retail price but we figured, "Hey, you know what? That's good enough. If they went to their bookstore they wouldn't be paying shipping, so the retail price is what they'd probably wind up paying. Let's show the students, who we love and admire, how much they'll ACTUALLY save, not some made up marketing hype mumbo jumbo 'if you buy seventeen of these and 4 of those from this special made up list that only exists in another dimension' kind of number that only marketing hype mumbo jumbo people can truly understand, and even that might be overstated." As such, the data is susceptible to error, and may not be statistically valid - but it's pretty darn good. home | make BIGWORDS.com your home page | site credits | contact us Copyright BIGGER Words, Inc. 2004.
