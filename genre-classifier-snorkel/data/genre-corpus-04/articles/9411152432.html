 Embedding R in Other Applications Embedding R in Other Applications On Unix, it is possible to compile R as a stand-alone library that can be linked with or dynamically loaded into other applications. One can then use the programming interface defined in the Writing R Extensions to evaluate R expressions, call R functions, access the math routines, provide a well-defined and complete scripting language, etc. Motivation There is little doubt that embedding the R library within a C routine that acts as a regular shell command is overkill. To do this, one could execute R in batch mode with a specified script that queried the vector commandArgs() . If C code is needed, it can be dynamically loaded into R (possibly with equal or less effort than creating an embedded application). In this case, the functionality of the application is achieved without the application being in control. Instead, R is the " server " in the setup. Even graphical interfaces which would appear to need to be in control of an application need not use the embedded R library. Instead, the regular stand-alone R can be used, again in batch mode, to invoke the R commands to create the GUI (using either of the Java or TclTk packages, or coding it directly in C using one of the GUI libraries and contending with the event loop!). However, the embedded R mechanism is useful in applications that really must be in control of initialization and execution. Long running servers are natural examples. The Postgres and MySQL servers are examples of such applications. Dynamic, event-driven processing systems that are given data at different times and update their computations accordingly (e.g. produce new reports and plots, inventory tracking, user signatures, etc.) are other examples. The Apache server is another example of where embedding a statistical environment is useful in two regards. Firstly, the R language can be used to generate pages in the same way that Perl, PHP, etc. are employed. A simple CGI command that specifies an R expression that uses the RSDBI package to extract values from a database and generate a plot (in Postscript, PNG, PDF, SVG, etc.) and return a page containing that image can be a simple way to produce high-quality graphics without the overhead of starting R each time. Not only can servers such as Postgres, MySQL and Apache allow its users to employ R by embedding it as a module, these systems might also use the statistical facilities (either native routines or via the interpreted language) to govern their own behavior. Computing models for transactions so that Apache can pre-fetch pages for clients or reorganize its own caches to optimize current activity are natural uses of the modelling code in R. Similarly, Postgres can tailor its performance by incrementally computing statistics about its own behavior. Test Applications The initial example that was used to test this setup was embedding R within Postgres for use as a procedural language. This allows (privileged) users to define SQL functions as R functions, expressions, etc. Additionally, tests were done by evaluating R expressions within a simple application that dynamically loaded libR.so ggobi that is linked against libR.so and contains a GUI callback. (This is not a very practical example as ggobi can be entirely embedded and controlled from within R.) Linking the R library $ (CC) -L $ (R_HOME)/bin -lR Initializing R from within an Application Currently, the following code will initialize the R engine. void initR() { char *argv[] = {"REmbeddedPostgres", "--gui=none", "--silent"}; int argc = sizeof(argv)/sizeof(argv[0]); Rf_initEmbeddedR(argc, argv); } When this is called, the environment variables such as R_HOME , R_PROFILE , R_LIBS should be appropriately set. There are a variety of tools which can help an application read configuration details. (For example, the C++ properties library in the Omegahat distribution allows one to read a file containing name: value pairs. ) Handling Errors An application that embeds R must be careful to take care of handling errors that occur within the R engine appropriately. In the stand-alone version of R, an error will (after other on.error() activities in each evaluation frame) return control to the main input-eval-print loop. In general, this is not what is desired within another application. Instead, we want to trap such R errors and handle them from where the application passed control to the R engine. This can be done most readily using the C routine R_tryEval to evaluate the S expression. This does exactly what we want by guaranteeing to return to this point in the calling code whether an error occurred or not in evaluating the expression. This routine is similar to eval , taking both the expression to evaluate and an environment in which to perform the evaluation. It takes a third argument which is the address of an integer. If this is non-NULL, when the call returns, this contains a flag indicating whether there was an error or not. Example int callFoo() { SEXP e, val; int errorOccurred; int result = -1; PROTECT(e = allocVector(LANGSXP, 1)); SETCAR(e, Rf_install("foo")); val = R_tryEval(e, R_GlobalEnv, &amp;errorOccurred); if(!errorOccurred) { PROTECT(val); result = INTEGER(val)[0]; UNPROTECT(1); } else { fprintf(stderr, "An error occurred when calling foo\n"); fflush(stderr); } /* Assume we have an INTSXP here. */ UNPROTECT(1); /* e */ return(result); } Note that this will, by default, take care of handling all types of errors that R would usually handle including signals. So if the user sends an interrupt to a computation (e.g. using Ctrl-C) while an R expression is being evaluated, R_tryEval will return and report an error. If the host application however changes the signal mask and/or handlers from R's own ones, of course this will not necessarily happen. In other words, the host application can control the signal handling differently. Handling The Event Loop As we have encountered when integrating other software into R and handling blocking I/O, software that assumes that it is in control of waiting for events can be challenging to embed in another application. So as to not inflict this same problem on others, R should be able to export the file descriptors on which it is waiting for events and also the individual callbacks associated with each these file descriptors. It is inconceivable that we can have a common C-level signature for the callbacks across different applications (other than those defined by the "standards" -- X, Gtk, Tk, etc.). Many applications that have an event loop do not admit the possibility of different sources of events, but instead assume there are only e.g. user events on a GUI and not on stdin or other connections. Compiling the Library The library is not compiled by default during the installation of R . One can pass the argument -enable-R-shlibs to the configure script and then build, as in &lt;top of R source tree&gt;/configure --enable-R-shlibs make The resulting (shared) library is currently installed into the directory bin/ within the R distribution. Future Directions It would be advantageous to decompose the functionality provided by the large libR.so into a collection of sub-libraries. Then users would be able to load just those that were needed for their applications. For example, continuing Brian's work to make the X11 be dynamically loadable and provide the Math routines as a stand-alone library, we might consider providing libraries for the following topics Parser and abstract syntax tree. Evaluator. Graphics. Modelling. Multiple Evaluators The ability to embed R raises the issue of having multiple evaluators, multiple threads, multiple users and synchronization of all of these. Examples This trivial example illustrates how to initialize the R environment and invoke an expression via the eval_R_command() void init_R() { extern Rf_initEmbeddedR(int argc, char **argv); int argc = 1; char *argv[] = {"ggobi"}; Rf_initEmbeddedR(argc, argv); } /* Calls the equivalent of x Routines for the Embedded R The following are the routines that are now visible from the shared library that directly relate to the embedded version of R and are not in the regular API (i.e. mentioned in Writing R Extensions ).

It usually calls Rf_resetStack() and returns control to the application. int Rf_resetStack (int resetTopLevel) Resets the R evaluator after an error so that subsequent evaluations can proceed appropriately. This should be called with a non-zero argument from applications that embed R. int Rf_initEmbeddedR (int argc, char **argv) Initializes the R environment, passing the specified strings as if they were from the command line.

<h1>Embedding R in Other Applications</h1>

On Unix, it is possible to compile R as a stand-alone library that can
be linked with or dynamically loaded into other applications. One can
then use the programming interface defined in the <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.pdf">Writing R
Extensions</a> to evaluate R expressions, call R functions, access the
math routines, provide a well-defined and complete scripting language,
etc.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
There is little doubt that embedding the R library within
a C routine that acts as a regular shell command is overkill.
To do this, one could execute R in batch mode with a specified
script that queried the vector <a
href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-alpha/library/base/html/commandArgs.html"><code
class="Rfunction">commandArgs()</code></a>.
If C code is needed, it can be dynamically loaded into R (possibly with
equal or less effort than creating an embedded application).
In this case, the functionality of the application is achieved
without the application being in control. Instead, R is the
"<i>server</i>" in the setup.
<p>

Even graphical interfaces which would appear to need to be in control
of an application need not use the embedded R library.  Instead, the
regular stand-alone R can be used, again in batch mode, to invoke the R
commands to create the GUI (using either of the <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RSJava/index.html">Java</a> or <a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-alpha/library/tcltk/html/00Index.html">TclTk</a>
packages, or coding it directly in C using one of the GUI libraries
and contending with the event loop!).

<p>

However, the embedded R mechanism is useful in applications that
really must be in control of initialization and execution.  Long
running servers are natural examples. The Postgres and MySQL servers
are examples of such applications.  Dynamic, event-driven processing
systems that are given data at different times and update their
computations accordingly (e.g. produce new reports and plots,
inventory tracking, user signatures, etc.) are other examples.  The
Apache server is another example of where embedding a statistical
environment is useful in two regards.  Firstly, the R language can be
used to generate pages in the same way that Perl, PHP, etc. are
employed. A simple CGI command that specifies an R expression that
uses the RSDBI package to extract values from a database and generate
a plot (in Postscript, PNG, PDF, SVG, etc.) and return a page
containing that image can be a simple way to produce high-quality
graphics without the overhead of starting R each time.

<p>

Not only can servers such as Postgres, MySQL and Apache allow its
users to employ R by embedding it as a module, these systems might
also use the statistical facilities (either native routines or via the
interpreted language) to govern their own behavior. Computing models
for transactions so that Apache can pre-fetch pages for clients or
reorganize its own caches to optimize current activity are natural
uses of the modelling code in R. Similarly, Postgres can tailor its
performance by incrementally computing statistics about its own
behavior.



<h2>Test Applications</h2>
The initial example that was used to test this setup was embedding R
within Postgres for use as a procedural language.
This allows (privileged) users to define SQL functions as
R functions, expressions, etc.  Additionally, tests were
done by evaluating R expressions within
<ol>
  <li> a simple application that dynamically loaded
      <code class="sharedLibary">libR.so</code>
  <li> ggobi that is linked against
      <code class="sharedLibary">libR.so</code>
      and contains a GUI callback.
      (This is not a very practical example
       as ggobi can be entirely embedded and controlled
       from within R.)
</ol>


<h2>Linking the R library</h2>
<pre class="Make">
  $(CC) -L$(R_HOME)/bin -lR
</pre>

<h2>Initializing R from within an Application</h2>

Currently, the following code will initialize the R engine.
<pre class="C">
void initR() {
 char *argv[] = {"REmbeddedPostgres", "--gui=none", "--silent"};
 int argc = sizeof(argv)/sizeof(argv[0]);

  Rf_initEmbeddedR(argc, argv);
}
</pre>

When this is called, the environment variables such as <code
class="environmentVar">R_HOME</code>, <code
class="environmentVar">R_PROFILE</code>, <code
class="environmentVar">R_LIBS</code> should be appropriately set.
There are a variety of tools which can help an application read
configuration details. (For example, the C++ properties library in the
Omegahat distribution allows one to read a file containing <code>name:
value</code> pairs.  )



<h2>Handling Errors</h2>

An application that embeds R must be careful to take care of handling
errors that occur within the R engine appropriately.  In the
stand-alone version of R, an error will (after other
<code class="Rfunction">on.error()</code> activities in each evaluation frame) return
control to the main input-eval-print loop.  In general, this is not
what is desired within another application.  Instead, we want to trap
such R errors and handle them from where the application passed
control to the R engine.

<p>

This can be done most readily using the C routine <code
class="Croutine">R_tryEval</code> to evaluate the S expression.  This
does exactly what we want by guaranteeing to return to this point in
the calling code whether an error occurred or not in evaluating the
expression.  This routine is similar to <code
class="Croutine">eval</code>, taking both the expression to evaluate
and an environment in which to perform the evaluation. It takes a
third argument which is the address of an integer. If this is
non-NULL, when the call returns, this contains a flag indicating
whether there was an error or not.

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="C">
int
callFoo()
{
 SEXP e, val;
 int errorOccurred;
 int result = -1;

 PROTECT(e = allocVector(LANGSXP, 1));
 SETCAR(e, Rf_install("foo"));

 val = R_tryEval(e, R_GlobalEnv, &amp;errorOccurred);

 if(!errorOccurred) {
   PROTECT(val);
   result = INTEGER(val)[0];
   UNPROTECT(1);
 } else {
   fprintf(stderr, "An error occurred when calling foo\n");
   fflush(stderr);
 }

    /* Assume we have an INTSXP here. */

 UNPROTECT(1); /* e */

return(result);
}
</pre>

Note that this will, by default, take care of handling all types of
errors that R would usually handle including signals.  So if the user
sends an interrupt to a computation (e.g. using Ctrl-C) while an R
expression is being evaluated, <code class="Croutine">R_tryEval</code>
will return and report an error.  If the host application however
changes the signal mask and/or handlers from R's own ones, of course
this will not necessarily happen. In other words, the host application
can control the signal handling differently.





<h2>Handling The Event Loop</h2>

As we have encountered when integrating other software into R and
handling blocking I/O, software that assumes that it is in control of
waiting for events can be challenging to embed in another application.
So as to not inflict this same problem on others, R should be able to
export the file descriptors on which it is waiting for events and also
the individual callbacks associated with each these file descriptors.
It is inconceivable that we can have a common C-level signature for
the callbacks across different applications (other than those defined
by the "standards" -- X, Gtk, Tk, etc.).  Many applications that have
an event loop do not admit the possibility of different sources of
events, but instead assume there are only e.g.  user events on a GUI
and not on <code>stdin</code> or other connections.



<h2>Compiling the Library</h2>
The library is not compiled by default during the installation of
<b>R</b>. One can pass the argument <code>-enable-R-shlibs</code>
to the configure script and then build, as in
<pre>
 &lt;top of R source tree&gt;/configure --enable-R-shlibs
  make
</pre>
The resulting (shared) library is <i>currently</i> installed into the
directory <code class="dir">bin/</code> within the <b>R</b> distribution.
<p>

<h2>Future Directions</h2>
It would be advantageous to decompose the functionality provided by
the large <code class="sharedLibrary>libR.so</code> into
a collection of sub-libraries. Then users would be able to
load just those that were needed for their applications.
For example, continuing Brian's work to make the X11 be
dynamically loadable and provide the Math routines
as a stand-alone library, we might consider providing
libraries for the following <i>topics</i>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Parser and abstract syntax tree.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> Evaluator.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> Graphics.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> Modelling.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h3>Multiple Evaluators</h3>

The ability to embed R raises the issue of having multiple evaluators,
multiple threads, multiple users and synchronization of all of these.


<h2>Examples</h2>
This trivial example illustrates how to initialize the
R environment and invoke an expression
via the <code class="Croutine">eval_R_command()</code>
<pre>
void
init_R()
{
extern Rf_initEmbeddedR(int argc, char **argv);
  int argc = 1;
  char *argv[] = {"ggobi"};

  Rf_initEmbeddedR(argc, argv);
}

 /*
  Calls the equivalent of 
    x <- integer(10)
    for(i in 1:length(x))
       x[i] <- 1
    print(x)
 */
int
eval_R_command()
{
 SEXP e;
 SEXP fun;
 SEXP arg;
 int i;
 void init_R(void);

  init_R();

    fun = Rf_findFun(Rf_install("print"),  R_GlobalEnv);
    PROTECT(fun);
    arg = NEW_INTEGER(10);
    for(i = 0; i < GET_LENGTH(arg); i++)
      INTEGER_DATA(arg)[i]  = i + 1;
    PROTECT(arg);

    e = allocVector(LANGSXP, 2);
    PROTECT(e);
    SETCAR(e, fun);
    SETCAR(CDR(e), arg);

      /* Evaluate the call to the R function.
         Ignore the return value.
       */
    eval(e, R_GlobalEnv);
    UNPROTECT(3);   
  return(0);
}
</pre>


<h2>Routines for the Embedded R</h2>

The following are the routines that are now visible from the shared
library that directly relate to the embedded version of R and are not
in the regular API (i.e. mentioned in <a
href="http://www.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.pdf">Writing R
Extensions</a>).

 <table>
  <tr align=center><td><font class="TD">Routine</code></td><td><font class="TD">Description</font></td></tr>
  <tr align=left><th>void
	  <code class="Croutine">jump_now</code>(void)</th><th>Should be overridden by the
	      application loading <code  class="sharedLibrary">libR.so</code>
	      so as to handle errors in R commands. It usually calls
	      <code class="Croutine">Rf_resetStack()</code>
	      and returns control to the application.
