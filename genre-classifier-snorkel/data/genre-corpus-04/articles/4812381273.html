Here's the outline of what I have in mind.&quot; He glanced at the young woman sitting at the far end of the table by the slide projector. &quot;Alice, can you give us the first slide, please?&quot; Alice dimmed the lights and switched on the projector. The studio boss continued in the half light: &quot;There are these two families, you see: the Points and the Lines. Basically, the series is about what these two families do, and the relationship between them.

That means we don't need trained actors. We can use more of those out-of-work schmucks from aerospace.&quot; All eyes turned to the second item written on the slide, as the studio boss jabbed at it with his cigar. It read: A Line has no breadth. &quot;Now, you guys are the best, so I'm going to give you a lot of freedom on this project,&quot; the boss growled. All you have to do is stick to five guiding principles for the way I want the series to go.

You can have a Line that connects any two Points. That should be clear enough.&quot; &quot;Number two. You can continue any Line as long as you want. No problem there, either. Hell, they do that in lots of long running series.&quot; &quot;The next one might need a bit of explaining. As you can see, what is says is 'Any Point can be the center of a Circle of any size.' My idea is that each episode can center around a particular person in the Point family. That episode will concentrate on the circle of friends of that person. Some weeks, it might be a small circle, other weeks a really big one - since the circle will be made up of Points, it doesn't make any difference to the budget.&quot; There was a chorus of appreciation around the table as the scriptwriters began to see the potential of the studio boss's overall idea to keep the budget down. &quot;Next one: 'All right angles are the same.'

<h1>How to sell soap</h1>

The studio boss looked at the fresh and eager faces 
seated around the long conference table at Plato 
Television Studios. Jabbing his long, fat cigar toward 
them to punch home each point, he began:<p>

&quot;You guys are the best series scriptwriters in town. 
I've invited you here today to offer you the chance of 
a lifetime: to work on the best television series the 
world has ever seen. Here's the outline of what I 
have in mind.&quot; <p>

He glanced at the young woman sitting at the far end 
of the table by the slide projector. &quot;Alice, can you give 
us the first slide, please?&quot; <p>

Alice dimmed the lights and switched on the 
projector. The studio boss continued in the half light: 
<p>

&quot;There are these two families, you see: the Points 
and the Lines. Basically, the series is about what 
these two families do, and the relationship between 
them. One of the great things about this idea is that 
I've set it up so the series is going to be really cheap 
to make. As you can see on the slide, we don't need 
to hire any actors for the Points, because the Points 
have no parts.&quot; <p>

The studio boss used his cigar to gesture toward the 
words on the screen at the first sentence, which 
read:

<blockquote>
<i>Points have no parts.</i>
</blockquote>

&quot;The idea,&quot; he continued, &quot;is to use digital special 
effects to represent the Points. Those computer 
graphics guys are cheap these days - every time the 
aerospace industry downsizes or a computer 
company is bought out by Microsoft, another 
thousand of them are thrown out of work and we can 
pick them up for a song.&quot; <p>

There was an audible sigh of relief around the room 
as each of the eleven scriptwriters realized how 
easily it could have been them to be forced to 
change careers in mid-life, but for the fortunate 
accident that they had flunked Algebra 2 at high 
school and studied English Lit. instead. <p>

&quot;We'll also save a ton of money on the Lines,&quot; the 
studio boss beamed, obviously pleased at his 
ingenuity. &quot;My idea is that a Line has no breadth. 
That means we don't need trained actors. We can 
use more of those out-of-work schmucks from 
aerospace.&quot; All eyes turned to the second item 
written on the slide, as the studio boss jabbed at it 
with his cigar. It read:

<blockquote>
<i>A Line has no breadth.</i>
</blockquote>

&quot;Now, you guys are the best, so I'm going to give you 
a lot of freedom on this project,&quot; the boss growled. All 
you have to do is stick to five guiding principles for 
the way I want the series to go. Next slide Alice.&quot; <p>

Everyone looked as the next slide appeared on the 
screen. <p>

&quot;I'll give you each a copy of this,&quot; said the studio 
boss, &quot;but let me summarize the five points you can 
see.&quot; <p>

&quot;Item one. You can have a Line that connects any 
two Points. That should be clear enough.&quot; <p>

&quot;Number two. You can continue any Line as long as 
you want. No problem there, either. Hell, they do that 
in lots of long running series.&quot; <p>

&quot;The next one might need a bit of explaining. As you 
can see, what is says is 'Any Point can be the center 
of a Circle of any size.' My idea is that each episode 
can center around a particular person in the Point 
family. That episode will concentrate on the circle of 
friends of that person. Some weeks, it might be a 
small circle, other weeks a really big one - since the 
circle will be made up of Points, it doesn't make any 
difference to the budget.&quot; <p>

There was a chorus of appreciation around the table 
as the scriptwriters began to see the potential of the 
studio boss's overall idea to keep the budget down. 
<p>

&quot;Next one: 'All right angles are the same.' Every 
series has to have an angle. You all learned that in 
Television 101. You also know that some angles are 
right for the intended audience, some are wrong. In 
my series, there's just one right angle. All other 
angles are wrong, and anyone who tries to introduce 
one will be off the show faster than I can say 'soap.' 
Understood?&quot; <p>

The studio boss looked around, daring anyone to 
respond to his challenge. No one did. The thought of 
all those unemployed former aerospace workers was 
still fresh in their minds, and they did not want to join 
them in the line for unemployment benefit. <p>

&quot;I'm not entirely sure I need the fifth guideline,&quot; said 
the studio boss, who was clearly enjoying showing 
off the genius of his new idea. &quot;It might be 
superfluous, given the other four. But I put it down 
just to be sure. It's a bit hard to follow - I'll get Alice to 
work on the text. But what it boils down to in simple 
terms is this: If one of you sets it up so that two of the 
Lines are not supposed to meet, then no matter who 
else takes over the storyline in a later episode, those 
two Lines are still not going to meet. Ever! Capisce?&quot; 
<p>

Everyone nodded. The boss leant back in his chair 
and chewed on his cigar. <p>

&quot;That's it. Any questions?&quot; <p>

There was silence for a moment, then a young 
woman half way along the table raised her hand. &quot;I 
think it's a great concept,&quot; she began. &quot;but I've got 
one question.&quot; <p>

&quot;Fire away,&quot; replied the studio boss. <p>

&quot;How long do you expect this to run? Thirteen 
weeks? Fifty-two? Or are you planning on something 
that goes on for years, like <i>As the World Turns</i> or 
<i>General Hospital</i>?&quot; <p>

The studio boss chuckled. &quot;Little lady, I don't think 
you've quite got the message as far as my overall 
concept is concerned.&quot; He gestured toward the five 
guiding principles on the screen. &quot;This idea is so 
insanely great, it has so much potential, it's going to 
change the world. Believe me, once it catches on 
and we get enough sponsors, this baby is going to 
run for thousands of years. Or my name's not Euclid.&quot;
