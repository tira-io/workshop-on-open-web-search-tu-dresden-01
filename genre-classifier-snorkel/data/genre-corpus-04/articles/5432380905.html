 The Math Forum - Math Library - Algebraic Geom. --> Browse and Search the Library Home : Math Topics : Geometry : Algebraic Geom. Library Home || Search || Full Table of Contents || Suggest a Link || Library Help Selected Sites (see also All Sites in this category ) Algebraic Geometry - Dave Rusin; The Mathematical Atlas A short article designed to provide an introduction to algebraic geometry, which combines the algebraic with the geometric for the benefit of both. Thus the recent proof of "Fermat's Last Theorem" - ostensibly a statement in number theory - was proved with geometric tools. Conversely, the geometry of sets defined by equations is studied using quite sophisticated algebraic machinery. This is an enticing area but the important topics are quite deep. This area includes elliptic curves. Applications and related fields and subfields; textbooks, reference works, and tutorials; software and tables; other web sites with this focus. more>> The Algebraic Geometry Notebooks - Aksel Sogstad For non-experts. Contents: What is algebraic geometry?; What can algebraic geometry be used for?; Classification of curves in the Weierstrass familiy; Bezout's Theorem; Varieties, orbits and orbit-spaces; Automatic theorem proving using Singular. more>> All Sites - 97 items found, showing 1 to 50 A 27-Vertex Graph That Is Vertex-Transitive and Edge-Transitive But Not 1-Transitive - Peter Doyle Hypertext and Postscript versions of a paper describing a 27-vertex graph that is vertex-transitive and edge-transitive but not 1-transitive.
