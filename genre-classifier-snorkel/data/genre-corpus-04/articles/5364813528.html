 Axiom of Choice a home page for the AXIOM OF CHOICE -- an introduction and links collection by Eric Schechter , Vanderbilt University The Axiom of Choice ( AC ) was formulated about a century ago, and it was controversial for a few of decades after that; it may be considered the last great controversy of mathematics. It is now a basic assumption used in many parts of mathematics. In fact, assuming AC is equivalent to assuming any of these principles (and many others): Given any two sets, one set has cardinality less than or equal to that of the other set -- i.e., one set is in one-to-one correspondence with some subset of the other. ( Historical remark: It was questions like this that led to Zermelo 's formulation of AC.) Any vector space over a field F has a basis -- i.e., a maximal linearly independent subset -- over that field. ( Remark: If we only consider the case where F is the real line, we obtain a slightly weaker statement; it is not yet known whether this statement is also equivalent to AC.) Any product of compact topological spaces is compact. (This is now known as Tychonoff's Theorem , though Tychonoff himself only had in mind a much more specialized result that is not equivalent to the Axiom of Choice.) AC has many forms; here is one of the simplest: Axiom of Choice. Let C be a collection of nonempty sets. Then we can choose a member from each set in that collection. In other words, there exists a function f defined on C with the property that, for each set S in the collection, f ( S ) is a member of S . The function f is then called a choice function . To understand this axiom better, let's consider a few examples. If C is the collection of all nonempty subsets of {1,2,3,...}, then we can define f quite easily: just let f ( S ) be the smallest member of S . If C is the collection of all intervals of real numbers with positive, finite lengths, then we can define f ( S ) to be the midpoint of the interval S . If C is some more general collection of subsets of the real line, we may be able to define f by using a more complicated rule. However, if C is the collection of all nonempty subsets of the real line, it is not clear how to find a suitable function f . In fact, no one has ever found a suitable function f for this collection C , and there are convincing model-theortic arguments that no one ever will. (Of course, to prove this requires a precise definition of "find," etc.) The controversy was over how to interpret the words "choose" and "exists" in the axiom: If we follow the constructivists, and "exist" means "find," then the axiom is false , since we cannot find a choice function for the nonempty subsets of the reals. However, most mathematicians give "exists" a much weaker meaning, and they consider the Axiom to be true: To define f ( S ), just arbitrarily "pick any member" of S . In effect, when we accept the Axiom of Choice, this means we are agreeing to the convention that we shall permit ourselves to use a choice function f in proofs, as though it "exists" in some sense, even though we cannot give an explicit example of it or an explicit algorithm for it. (For an introduction to constructivism, you might take a look at my paper on that subject. The term has rather different, slightly related meanings in advanced mathematics and in mathematics education; I am referring to the former meaning here.) The "existence" of f -- or of any mathematical object, even the number "3" -- is purely formal. It does not have the same kind of solidity as your table and your chair; it merely exists in the mental universe of mathematics. Many different mathematical universes are possible. When we accept or reject the Axiom of Choice, we are specifying which universe we shall work in. Both possibilities are feasible -- i.e., neither accepting nor rejecting AC yields a contradiction; that follows from models devised by G&ouml;del and Cohen . Some mathematicians have further investigated what happens when we reject AC but accept some weakened variant -- for example, CC (Countable Choice), which permits a sequence of arbitrary choices. However, most "ordinary" mathematicians -- i.e., most mathematicians who are not logicians or set theorists -- accept the Axiom of Choice chiefly because their work is simpler with the Axiom of Choice than without it. The full strength of the Axiom of Choice does not seem to be needed for applied mathematics. Some weaker principle such as CC or DC generally would suffice. To see this, consider that any application is based on measurements, but humans can only make finitely many measurements. We can extrapolate and take limits, but usually those limits are sequential, so even in theory we cannot make use of more than countably many measurements. The resulting spaces are separable. Even if we use a nonseparable space such as L &#165; , this may be merely to simplify our notation; the relevant action may all be happening in some separable subspace, which we could identify with just a bit more effort. (Thus, in some sense, nonseparable spaces exist only in the imagination of mathematicians.) If we restrict our attention to separable spaces, then much of conventional analysis still works with AC replaced by CC or DC. However, the resulting exposition is then more complicated, and so this route is only followed by a few mathematicians who have strong philosophical leanings against AC. A few pure mathematicians and many applied mathematicians (including, e.g., some mathematical physicists) are uncomfortable with the Axiom of Choice. Although AC simplifies some parts of mathematics, it also yields some results that are unrelated to, or perhaps even contrary to, everyday "ordinary" experience; it implies the existence of some rather bizarre, counterintuitive objects. Perhaps the most bizarre is the Banach-Tarski Paradoxical Decomposition . Banach and Tarski used the Axiom of Choice to prove that it is possible to take the 3-dimensional closed unit ball, B = { ( x , y , z ) &#206; R 3 : x 2 + y 2 + z 2 &lt; 1 } and partition it into finitely many pieces, and move those pieces in rigid motions (i.e., rotations and translations, with pieces permitted to move through one another) and reassemble them to form two copies of B . At first glance, the Banach-Tarski Decomposition seems to contradict some of our intuition about physics -- e.g., the Law of Conservation of Mass, from classical Newtonian physics. Consequently, the Decomposition is often called the Banach-Tarski Paradox . But actually, it only yields a complication, not a contradiction. If we assume a uniform density, only a set with a defined volume can have a defined mass. The notion of "volume" can be defined for many subsets of R 3 , and beginners might expect the notion to apply to all subsets of R 3 , but it does not. More precisely, Lebesgue measure is defined on some subsets of R 3 , but it cannot be extended to all subsets of R 3 in a fashion that preserves two of its most important properties: the measure of the union of two disjoint sets is the sum of their measures, and measure is unchanged under translation and rotation. Thus, the Banach-Tarski Paradox does not violate the Law of Conservation of Mass; it merely tells us that the notion of "volume" is more complicated than we might have expected. By the way, the sets in the Banach-Tarski Decomposition cannot be described explicitly; we are merely able to prove their existence , like that of a choice function. One or more of the sets in the decomposition must be Lebesgue unmeasurable; thus a corollary of the Banach-Tarski Theorem is the fact that there exist sets that are not Lebesgue measurable. The existence of unmeasurable sets has a much shorter and easier proof, which can be found in every introductory textbook on measure theory. That proof also uses the Axiom of Choice, but doesn't mention the Banach-Tarski Decomposition. Personally, I am not surprised to find the Axiom of Choice coming into play in a subject that is so inherently complicated as unmeasurable sets. I am much more surprised to find AC coming into play in a seemingly much simpler and more concrete setting: the integers. Let W be an infinite set (for instance, the integers). By a filter on the set W , we mean a method of classifying all subsets of W so that (i) certain subsets of W are called "large"; (ii) any set containing a large set is large; (iii) the intersection of two large sets is large; (iv) the empty set is not large. It follows easily from these rules that a set and its complement cannot both be large. Thus, we do not get a filter on the integers by calling all infinite sets "large," since both the even integers and the odd integers are infinite sets. We do get an example of a filter by calling a set "large" if it is cofinite -- i.e., if its complement is finite. However, that example does not satisfy the next condition. An ultrafilter satisfies the preceding conditions plus this additional condition: (v) for each set S &#205; W , either S is large or the complement of S is large. For an example of an ultrafilter, pick some particular point w 0 in W , and use this classification scheme: say that a set S is "large" if and only if w 0 &#206; S. However, that example does not satisfy the next condition. A nonprincipal ultrafilter satisfies the preceding conditions plus this additional requirement: (vi) no finite set is large. Now, the existence of such a classification scheme can be prove using the Axiom of Choice. (Sketch of proof: start from the filter of cofinite sets, and extend it to a maximal filter using Zorn's Lemma, also known as the Kuratowski-Zorn Theorem.) However, it turns out that we cannot actually find an explicit example of a nonprincipal ultrafilter. (This result may be simpler than the Banach-Tarski Paradox, but it does not really get us away from measure theory. A nonprincipal ultrafilter is essentially the same thing as a two-valued probability measure that is finitely additive but not countably additive.) Bertrand Russell (more famous for his work in philosophy and political activism, but also an accomplished mathematician) once said, To choose one sock from each of infinitely many pairs of socks requires the Axiom of Choice, but for shoes the Axiom is not needed. The idea is that the two socks in a pair are identical in appearance, and so we must make an arbitrary choice if we wish to choose one of them. For shoes, we can use an explicit algorithm -- e.g., "always choose the left shoe." Why does Russell's statement mention infinitely many pairs? Well, if we only have finitely many pairs of socks, then AC is not needed -- we can choose one member of each pair using the definition of "nonempty," and we can repeat an operation finitely many times using the rules of formal logic (not discussed here). Jerry Bona once said, The Axiom of Choice is obviously true; the Well Ordering Principle is obviously false; and who can tell about Zorn's Lemma? This is a joke . In the setting of ordinary set theory, all three of those principles are mathematically equivalent -- i.e., if we assume any one of those principles, we can use it to prove the other two. However, human intuition does not always follow what is mathematically correct. The Axiom of Choice agrees with the intuition of most mathematicians; the Well Ordering Principle is contrary to the intuition of most mathematicians; and Zorn's Lemma is so complicated that most mathematicians are not able to form any intuitive opinion about it. Links Collection for AC Please write to me if you have suggestions for additions or alterations to this web page. However, I will warn you that I am not a leading authority on the Axiom of Choice; I am not knowledgeable about much of the advanced research on the subject. I have posted this web page chiefly because (i) I like the Axiom of Choice; (ii) I think I have a good understanding of the elementary aspects of the subject; and (iii) I like posting web pages. Introductory / elementary Another online introduction currently available for AC is the Math FAQ . It also includes an introduction to the Banach-Tarski paradox . For more extensive information about the Banach-Tarski Paradox, see Stan Wagon's book . Handbook of Analysis and its Foundations , by Eric Schechter. The website is an advertisement, but it does include a few interesting excerpts from the book -- e.g., a list of 27 forms of the Axiom of Choice and a few dozen weak forms of Choice, as well as a chart showing how some of the weak forms are related. (The book is intended for beginning graduate students; only a small portion of the book is actually concerned with Choice.) The Math History Archive contains some mentions of AC. See especially: the beginnings of set theory , Cantor , Hausdorff , Zermelo , Sierpinski , Kuratowski , Zorn .

Constructivism is Difficult -- a brief introduction to constructivism. Constructivism and AC are two different but overlapping topics. AC is a nonconstructive axiom; that's what made it so controversial. Topological Equivalents of the Axiom of Choice and of Weak Forms of Choice by Eric Schechter -- a brief introduction to this subject, which I wrote for the ``Topology Atlas'' One of AC's most important applications in analysis is the Hahn-Banach Theorem. It may be viewed as a weak form of Choice. Here is an on-line survey article, The Hahn-Banach Theorem: The Life and Times , by Lawrence Narici and Edward Beckenstein. Axiome du Choix , by David Madore . This page includes a list of several equivalents and weaker consequences of AC, and a list of some of the implications among them. If your French is weak, you might try an automatic translation service, such as AV's translator . However, such translation programs don't know mathematics, and so some of the results may be a bit odd. For instance, what we call "well ordering" is what the French call "bon ordre," but the AV translator turns that into "good command." An introduction to the gauge integral , by me (Eric Schechter). We might replace the Riemann integral with the gauge integral in our freshman calculus courses. It is similar in most respects, and is better in many respects. The Axiom of Choice gets mentioned near the end of the discussion (but I'm not advocating telling the freshmen about the Axiom of Choice). The ProvenMath website includes a web page on AC . That page includes formal statements of several of the equivalents of AC, and formal proofs of equivalence. To read the statements and proofs, you'll need to familiarize yourself with the notation that ProvenMath uses for representing mathematical symbols on web pages. Especially noteworthy books and/or researchers Consequences of the Axiom of Choice is a book by Paul Howard and Jean E. Rubin that was published by the American Mathematical Society in 1998. It is a vast survey of Choice and its weaker relatives. It is a reference book, not intended for beginners. The authors are continuing their research project, which now goes a bit beyond the book. Their web page contains a list of the errata and addenda to the book, and a form for downloading copies of the project's main tables. You may also want to look at some related papers . Home page of Thomas Jech . Jech is the author of the book titled The Axiom of Choice , which is not recent but is still excellent. He has worked in set theory, logic, and other areas since then. Some of his papers are available online. Saharon Shelah's papers . Shelah is one of the leading logicians of our century; he has made great contributions to the theory of forcing. My favorite among his results is the fact that Con(ZF) implies Con(ZF + DC + BP); this result was shown by J.D.M.Wright to be important to functional analysis. (It's explained further in my book.) Among Shelah's subpages is a list of his coauthors , many of whom have web pages of their own. Andreas Blass 's home page. It is a very old result that the Axiom of Choice implies the existence of bases for vector spaces; Blass can be credited with proving the converse. Blass also did some of the early work on proving the unconstructability of nonprincipal ultrafilters. (Those are results of his that I've understood; he has probably done some other much more important things that I don't understand.) Edward Nelson's home page . Nelson is the father of Internal Set Theory (IST), a variant of Nonstandard Analysis. IST has acquired a large following; some analysts are of the opinion that IST is the most intuitive approach to limits. (Personally, I suspect that most of those analysts were first trained as logicians, but that may be a reflection of my own ignorance.) Some of Nelson's writings are available online. Home page of Fred Richman , a leading constructivist. The page includes some amusing subpages, e.g., Confessions of a formalist, Platonist intuitionist -- (Hey, I thought those terms contradicted each other!) -- and Math without countable choice .

NF is a refinement of Russell's theory of types, introduced by Quine in 1937. Thus, it is an alternate form of set theory or higher-order logic, a little different from conventional set theory, but still capable of doing approximately the same things. Of course, it differs from the usual set theory in a few respects; an obvious difference is that there is a universal set in NF. A surprising difference is that the Axiom of Choice is false in NF ; this was established in a 1953 paper by E.P.Specker.

A Survey of the QED Project and Related Topics Miscellaneous Newsgroups: sci.logic , sci.philosophy.tech , sci.math , sci.math.research sometimes contain something about AC. Kurt Godel in Blue Hill , a description of Godel and some of his work, by Peter Suber Adib Ben Jebara has been working on a web page about a possible connection between Fermat's Last Theorem and the Axiom of Choice . It's a work in progress, and I don't fully understand it yet, and I don't know whether he'll eventually be able to fill in the details that are still needed in his proof, but he asked me to put this link here. Fermat's Last Theorem, you recall, says that x n +y n =z n has no solution in positive integers x,y,z,n with n&gt;2. Ben Jebara is considering x N +y N =z N , where N is the set of all positive integers; thus x N represents the Cartesian product of countably many copies of a finite set x (or, equivalently (?), the collection of all sequences that take their values in a finite set x). Of related interest is a paper by Andreas Blass, "Sums, Products, and Choice for Finite Sets" . The Axiom of Choice was used for a tongue-in-cheek "proof" of the existence of God, in "God exists!", Nous 21 (1987), 345-361. The basic idea is to put a suitable partial ordering on the universe, and then use Zorn's Lemma to prove the existence of a maximal element, which is therefore God. A web page on this topic has been made available by Alexander Pruss. A musical band named Axiom of Choice . Their music is a fusion of Persian Traditional with modern. Okay, it's not math, but I couldn't resist posting this here. Iranian born guitarist Ramin Torkian and singer Mamek Khadem were both trained as mathematicians, and that's where the group gets its name. Their first album's liner notes say "There is an exciting and profound artistic value in the mathematical principle, Axiom of Choice. The mathematician has the right to choose elements without explanation. In a world where everything must be explained, these choices are voluntary and do not need explanation."

The Axiom of Choice (<B>AC</B>) was formulated about a century ago,
and it was controversial for a few of decades
after that; it may be considered the last
great controversy of mathematics.  It is now a basic
assumption used in many parts of mathematics.  In fact,
assuming AC is equivalent to assuming
any of these principles (and many others):
<UL>

<LI>Given any two sets, one set has cardinality less than or equal
to that of the other set -- i.e., one set is in one-to-one
correspondence with some subset of the other.  (<I>Historical
remark:</i> It was questions like this that led to
<a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Zermelo.html">Zermelo</a>'s
formulation of AC.)

<LI>Any vector space over a field F has a basis --
i.e., a maximal linearly independent subset -- over that field.
(<I>Remark:</i> If we only consider the case where F is the
real line, we obtain a slightly weaker statement; it is not
yet known whether this statement is also equivalent to AC.)


<LI>Any product of compact topological spaces is compact.  (This is
now known as <I>Tychonoff's Theorem</I>, though Tychonoff himself
only had in mind a much more specialized result that is <I>not</I>
equivalent to the Axiom of Choice.)
</ul>


<P>

AC has many forms; here
is one of the simplest:<P>
<center>
<table width=60% border=6 cellpadding=12 cellspacing=12><tr><td>
<B>Axiom of Choice.</B>
Let <I>C</I> be a collection of nonempty sets.  Then we can <I>choose</I>
a member from each set in that collection.  In other words, there
exists a function <I>f</I> defined on <I>C</I> with the property that, for each
set <I>S</I> in the collection, <I>f</I>(<I>S</I>) is a member of <I>S</I>.</td></tr></table>
</center><P>
The function <I>f</I> is then called a <I>choice function</I>.
<P>
To understand this axiom better, let's consider a few
examples.
<ol>
<LI>If <I>C</I> is the collection of all nonempty
subsets of {1,2,3,...}, then we can define <I>f</I> quite
easily:  just let <I>f</I>(<I>S</I>) be the smallest member of <I>S</I>.
<LI>If <I>C</I> is the collection of all intervals of real
numbers with positive, finite lengths, then we can define
<I>f</I>(<I>S</I>) to be the midpoint of the interval <I>S</I>.
<LI>If <I>C</I> is some more general collection of subsets of the
real line, we may be able to define <I>f</I> by using a more
complicated rule.
<LI>However, if <I>C</I> is the collection of <I>all</I> nonempty
subsets of the real line, it is not clear how to find
a suitable function <I>f</I>.  In fact, no one has ever
found a suitable function <I>f</I> for this collection <I>C</I>, and
there are convincing model-theortic 
arguments that no one ever will.
(Of course, to <i>prove</i> this requires a precise
definition of "find," etc.)
</ol>
The controversy was over how to interpret the words
"choose" and "exists" in the axiom:
<ul>
<li>If we follow the constructivists, and "exist"
means "find," then the axiom is
<i>false</i>, since we cannot find a choice function
for the nonempty subsets of the reals.

<li>However, most mathematicians give "exists" a much weaker
meaning, and they consider the Axiom to be true:  
To define <I>f</I>(<I>S</I>), just
arbitrarily "pick any member" of <I>S</I>.  
</ul>

In effect, when we accept the Axiom of Choice, this
means we are agreeing to the convention that we shall permit
ourselves to use a choice function <I>f</I> in proofs, 
as though it "exists" in some sense, even though we cannot give
an explicit example of it or an explicit algorithm for it.
(For an introduction to constructivism, you might
take a look at <a
href="http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~schectex/papers/#difficult">my
paper</a> on that subject.  The term has rather
different, slightly related meanings in advanced
mathematics and in mathematics education; I am referring
to the former meaning here.)


<P>

The "existence" of <I>f</I> -- or of any mathematical
object, even the number "3" -- is purely formal.  It
does not have the same kind of solidity as your table and your
chair; it merely exists in the mental universe of mathematics.
Many different mathematical universes are possible.  When we
accept or reject the Axiom of Choice, we are specifying
which universe we shall work in.  Both possibilities
are feasible -- i.e., neither accepting nor
rejecting AC yields a contradiction; that follows from
models devised by 
<a
href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Godel.html">G&ouml;del</a>
and <a
href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Cohen.html">Cohen</a>.
Some mathematicians
have further investigated what happens when we reject AC
but accept some weakened variant -- for example,
CC (Countable Choice), which permits a <i>sequence</i> of
arbitrary choices.  However,
most "ordinary" mathematicians -- i.e., most mathematicians
who are not logicians or set theorists --
accept the Axiom of Choice chiefly 
because their work is <I>simpler</I> with the Axiom of Choice
than without it.

<P>

The full strength of the Axiom of Choice does
not seem to be needed for <i>applied</i> mathematics.
Some weaker principle such as CC or DC 
generally would suffice.  To see this, consider that
any application is based on measurements, but humans
can only make <i>finitely many</i> measurements.
We can extrapolate and take limits, but usually
those limits are sequential, so even in theory we
cannot make use of more than countably many
measurements.  The resulting spaces are separable.
Even if we use a nonseparable space such as
L<sup><font face=symbol>&#165;</font></sup>, this
may be merely to simplify our notation; the
relevant action may all be happening in some
separable subspace, which we could identify
with just a bit more effort.  (Thus, in some
sense, nonseparable spaces exist <i>only</i>
in the imagination of mathematicians.)  If we restrict
our attention to separable spaces, then much
of conventional analysis still works with
AC replaced by CC or DC.  However, the
resulting exposition is then more complicated,
and so this route is only followed by a few
mathematicians who have strong philosophical
leanings against AC.

<P>

A few pure mathematicians and many applied mathematicians
(including, e.g., some mathematical physicists) are
uncomfortable with the Axiom of Choice.  Although
AC simplifies some parts of mathematics, it also 
yields some results that are unrelated to, or perhaps even
contrary to, everyday "ordinary" experience; it implies the
existence of some rather bizarre, counterintuitive
objects.  Perhaps the most bizarre is the
<B>Banach-Tarski Paradoxical Decomposition</B>.  <a
href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Banach.html">Banach</a>
and <a
href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Tarski.html">Tarski</a>
used the Axiom of Choice to
prove that it is possible to take the 3-dimensional
closed unit ball,
<center><i>B</i> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <font 
size=+2>{</font>(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>)
<font face=symbol>&#206;</font> <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>
: <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>z</i><sup>2</sup> 
<U>&lt;</U> 1<font size=+2>}</font></center>
and partition it into finitely many pieces, and move those
pieces in rigid motions (i.e., rotations and translations,
with pieces permitted to move through one another) and
reassemble them to form <I>two</I> copies of <i>B</i>.

<P>At first glance, the Banach-Tarski Decomposition
seems to contradict some of our intuition about physics
-- e.g., the Law of Conservation of Mass, from classical
Newtonian physics.  Consequently, the Decomposition is
often called the  Banach-Tarski <I>Paradox</i>. But
actually, it only yields a complication, not a
contradiction.  If we assume a uniform density, only a
set with a defined <i>volume</i> can have a defined mass.
The notion of "volume" can be defined for many subsets
of  <B>R</b><sup>3</sup>,  and beginners might expect the
notion to apply to all subsets of <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>,
but it does not.  More precisely, <i>Lebesgue measure</i>
is defined on some subsets of  <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>, but
it cannot be extended to <i>all</i> subsets of 
<b>R</b><sup>3</sup> in a fashion that preserves two of
its most important properties:  the measure of the union
of two disjoint sets is the sum of their measures, and
measure is unchanged under translation and rotation.
Thus, the Banach-Tarski Paradox does not violate the Law
of Conservation of Mass; it merely tells us that the
notion of "volume" is more complicated than we might have
expected. <P>

By the way, the sets in the Banach-Tarski Decomposition
cannot be described explicitly; we are merely able to
prove their <I>existence</I>, like that of a choice
function. One or more of the sets in the decomposition
must be Lebesgue unmeasurable; thus a corollary of the
Banach-Tarski Theorem is the fact that there exist sets
that are not Lebesgue measurable.  The existence of
unmeasurable sets has a much shorter and easier proof,
which can be found in every introductory textbook on
measure theory.  That proof also uses the Axiom of
Choice, but doesn't mention the Banach-Tarski
Decomposition.

<P>

Personally, I am not surprised to find the Axiom of Choice
coming into play in a subject that is so inherently
complicated as unmeasurable sets.
I am much more surprised to find AC coming into play
in a seemingly
much simpler  and more concrete setting:  the integers.
Let 
<font face=symbol>W</font>
be an infinite set
(for instance, the integers).
By a <i>filter</i> on the set 
<font face=symbol>W</font>, we
mean a
method of classifying all subsets of <font face=symbol>W</font> so that
<ul>
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; certain subsets of <font face=symbol>W</font> are called "large";<BR>
(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; any set
containing a large set is large;<BR>
(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp; the intersection of two
large sets is large;<BR>
(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp; the empty set is not large.
</ul>
It follows easily from these rules that a set and its complement
cannot both be large.  Thus, we do not get a filter 
on the integers by calling
all infinite sets "large," since both the even integers and
the odd integers are infinite sets.  We do get an example of a
filter by calling a set "large" if it is <i>cofinite</i> -- i.e.,
if its complement is finite.  However, that example does not
satisfy the next condition.
An <i>ultrafilter</i> satisfies the preceding conditions
plus this additional condition:<ul>
(v)&nbsp;&nbsp; for each set 
S&nbsp;<font face=symbol>&#205;</font>&nbsp;<font face=symbol>W</font>,
either S is large or
the complement of S is large.</ul>
For an example of an ultrafilter, 
pick some particular point 
<font face=symbol>w</font><sub>0</sub> in
<font face=symbol>W</font>, and 
use this classification
scheme:  say that a set S is "large" if and only if 
<font face=symbol>w</font><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;<font face=symbol>&#206;</font>&nbsp;S.
However, that example does not
satisfy the next condition.  A <b>nonprincipal
ultrafilter</b> satisfies the preceding conditions
plus this additional requirement:
<ul>(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp; no
finite set is large.
</ul>Now, the <i>existence</i> of such a classification
scheme can be prove using the
Axiom of Choice.
(Sketch of proof:  start from the
filter of cofinite sets, and extend it to a maximal
filter using Zorn's Lemma, also known as the
Kuratowski-Zorn Theorem.)
However,
it turns out that we cannot actually
<i>find an explicit example</i> of a
nonprincipal ultrafilter.
(This result may be simpler than the
Banach-Tarski Paradox, but it
does not really get us away from measure
theory.  A nonprincipal ultrafilter is essentially
the same thing as a two-valued probability measure
that is finitely additive but not countably additive.)

<a
href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Russell.html">Bertrand
Russell</a> (more famous for his work in philosophy and political
activism, but also an accomplished mathematician) once said, 
<blockquote>
To choose one sock from each of
infinitely many pairs of socks requires the Axiom of Choice,
but for shoes the Axiom is not needed.
</blockquote>
The idea is that
the two socks in a pair are identical in appearance, and
so we must make an arbitrary choice if we wish to choose
one of them.  For shoes, we can use an explicit algorithm --
e.g., "always choose the left shoe."  Why does Russell's statement
mention <i>infinitely many</i> pairs?  Well, if we only have
finitely many pairs of socks, then AC is not needed --
we can choose one member of each pair using the
definition of "nonempty," and we can repeat an operation
finitely many times using the rules of formal logic
(not discussed here).

<P>

Jerry Bona once said,
<blockquote>
The Axiom of Choice is obviously true; the Well Ordering
Principle
is obviously false; and who can tell about Zorn's Lemma?
</blockquote>
This is a <i>joke</i>.  In the setting of ordinary
set theory, all three of those principles are mathematically
<i>equivalent</i> -- i.e., if we assume any one of
those principles, we can use it to prove the other two.  
However, human intuition does not
always follow what is mathematically correct.  
The Axiom of Choice agrees with the intuition of most
mathematicians; the Well Ordering Principle is contrary
to the intuition of most mathematicians; and Zorn's Lemma
is so complicated that most mathematicians are not able
to form any intuitive opinion about it.

I don't fully understand it yet, and I don't know whether
he'll eventually be able to fill in 
the details that are still needed in

link here.  Fermat's Last Theorem, you recall,
says that x<sup>n</sup>+y<sup>n</sup>=z<sup>n</sup> has
no solution in positive integers x,y,z,n with n&gt;2.
Ben Jebara is considering 
x<sup>N</sup>+y<sup>N</sup>=z<sup>N</sup>, where
N is the <i>set</I> of all positive integers; thus
x<sup>N</sup> represents the Cartesian product of countably
many copies of a finite set x (or, equivalently (?), the
collection of all sequences that take their values in a
finite set x).  Of related interest is a paper
