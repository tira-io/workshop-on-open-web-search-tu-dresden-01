<h1>Multivariate Statistics: An Introduction</h1>

<p>Welcome to this introduction to the family of data analysis techniques often grouped
together under the name, &quot;multivariate statistics.&quot; The word multivariate should
say it all -- these techniques look at the pattern of relationships between several
variables simultaneously. This may sound scary, but fear not -- you do not need training
in highly advanced statistics to follow the explanation in these pages. We will look at
three types of multivariate methods -- <a HREF="factor.htm">factor analysis</a>, <a HREF="mds.htm">multidimensional scaling</a>, and <a HREF="cluster.htm">cluster analysis</a>.</p>

<h4>How do these techniques differ from regression?</h4>

<ul>
  <p>In multiple regression and analysis of variance, several variables are used, however
  one -- a dependent variable -- is generally predicted or explained by means of the
  other(s) -- independent variables and covariates. These are called <strong>dependence
  methods</strong>.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
  <p>Factor analysis, multidimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster analysis look at <strong>interrelationships
  </strong>among variables. They are not generally used in prediction, there is no <em>p</em>-value,
  and the researcher interprets the output of the analysis and determines the best model.
  This can be frustrating! (See <a HREF="cautions.htm">cautions for novice researchers</a>.)</p>
</ul>

<h4>What are the assumptions of multivariate analyses?</h4>

<ul>
  <p>All of the models require that input data be in the form of interrelationships -- this
  means correlations for factor analysis. MDS and cluster analysis can use a variety of
  different input data -- distances, or measures of similarity or proximity. This means that
  MDS and cluster analysis can be somewhat more flexible than factor analysis.</p>
  <p>A <strong>big</strong> assumption of these methods is that the data itself is <strong><em>valid
  </em></strong>. (See Trochim's <a HREF="http://trochim.human.cornell.edu/kb/kbhome.htm">Knowledge
  Base</a> for a discussion of validity, especially <a HREF="http://trochim.human.cornell.edu/kb/constval.htm">construct validity</a>.) Because
  these methods do not use the same logic of statistical inference that dependence methods
