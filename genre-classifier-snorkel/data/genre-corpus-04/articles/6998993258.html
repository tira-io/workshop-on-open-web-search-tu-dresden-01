The WWW is changing the nature of software development to a distributive plug &amp; play process, which requires a new kind of managing software: intelligent software brokers. Results Part of IBROW is the development of the The Unified Problem-solving Method Development Language UPML . UPML has been developed to describe and implement such architectures and components to facilitate their semiautomatic reuse and adaptation. Spoken in a nutshell, UPML is a framework for developing knowledge-intensive reasoning systems based on libraries of generic problem-solving components. UPML provides a Prot&eacute;g&eacute; -based editor for writing specifications. top Tools for UPML Prot&eacute;g&eacute; support for UPML . We used Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-2000 to develop the meta-ontology of UPML and a graphical editor for creating instances of UPML specifications. Background and download information on Prot&eacute;g&eacute; can be found here . We defined the meta-ontology of UPML in Prot&eacute;g&eacute; as a hierarchy of classes, with slots and facets attached to them. Then, we customized the knowledge acquisition tool generated by Prot&eacute;g&eacute; to create the UPML editor for authoring instances of UPML specifications. For example, we defined specific kinds of diagrams to enter the task decomposition of a complex PSM and the structure of its corresponding operational control. Finally, we entered the specification of the case study of D. Fensel et al.: The Unified Problem-solving Method description Language UPML. Using Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-2000's support for RDF(S), we can also generate RDF documents out of UPML specifications. This work helped us better identify the concepts and relations of UPML necessary to provide a guided framework for defining UPML specifications. Besides further experimenting UPML usability by creating additional instances of problem-solving components, we are currently developing a PSM browser and editor as a plug-in to Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. top Papers on UPML Dieter Fensel, V.
