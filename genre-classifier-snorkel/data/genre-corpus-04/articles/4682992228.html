 Rapide -- Overview The Stanford Rapide Project Overview Of The Rapide Prototyping Project The Rapide Language effort focuses on developing a new technology for building large-scale, distributed multi-language systems. This technology is based upon a new generation of computer languages, called Executable Architecture Definition Languages (EADLs), and an innovative toolset supporting the use of EADLs in evolutionary development and rigorous analysis of large-scale systems. The present Rapide-1.0 effort leverages off of Stanford's Rapide-0.2 effort, and on our prior work on applying formal methods to Ada and VHDL. Rapide is designed to support component-based development of large, multi-language systems by utilizing architecture definitions as the development framework. Rapide allows gradual refinement of architectures into products, and supports testing and maintenance based on automated comparison with formal standard architectures. Rapide adopts a new event-based execution model of distributed, time-sensitive systems -- the "timed poset model." Posets provide the most detailed formal basis to date for constructing early life cycle prototyping tools, and later life cycle tools for correctness and performance analysis of distributed time-sensitive systems.

Specification Capabilities For EADLs The Rapide specification language is planned to allow specification of both constraints on concurrent patterns of events (posets) and real-time constraints.

EADL-Based Formal Reference Architectures For Industrial Systems We plan to define formal reference architectures for particular industrial systems in Rapide (e.g., X/Open DTP and other industry standards), analyze them formally for various critical properties, (e.g., consistency, liveness, durability and real-time constraints), and propose them as standard formal architecture definitions. Consistency Analysis Tools To Compare Architectures Rapide support tools will include comparative simulation tools to support consistency analysis between architectures.

The architecture definition language provides executable features for composing systems out of component interfaces by defining their synchronization and communication interconnections in terms of patterns of events. These features provide powerful new constructs for defining very large, possibly dynamic, architectures. Moreover, event pattern constructs are used to define mappings between architectures. These EADL mappings are implementable to provide new tools for automatically comparing system architectures at differing abstraction levels in hierarchically designed systems, and for monitoring actual systems for conformance with industry standard architectures. The constraint language provides constructs for abstract specification of the behavior of a distributed system, including timing requirements. It is a constraint-based language, based on the timed poset model, that supplies constructs for defining patterns of events that are required (or forbidden) in the computation of a distributed system. Component interfaces and architectures may be given detailed abstract specifications using the specification language. The executable language is a concurrent reactive programming language. It uses types, objects, and expressions of the type language, and provides module and control structures. Its principal constructs are independent (or concurrent) reactive processes that activate when patterns of events occur during execution. These pattern-triggered processes are used (i) to define architecture connections between components, and (ii) to construct behaviors of components by rule-based, reactive programming techniques. The executable language also provides standard kinds of Algol-like control structures, subprograms, exception raising and handling constructs, and timing features.

<h2>Overview Of The Rapide Prototyping Project</h2>

<p>The Rapide Language effort focuses on developing a new technology
for building large-scale, distributed multi-language systems. This
technology is based upon a new generation of computer languages,
called Executable Architecture Definition Languages (EADLs), and an
innovative toolset supporting the use of EADLs in evolutionary
development and rigorous analysis of large-scale systems.

<p>The present Rapide-1.0 effort leverages off of Stanford's Rapide-0.2
effort, and on our prior work on applying formal methods to Ada and
VHDL.

<p>Rapide is designed to support component-based development of large,
multi-language systems by utilizing architecture definitions as the
development framework. Rapide allows gradual refinement of
architectures into products, and supports testing and maintenance
based on automated comparison with formal standard architectures.
Rapide adopts a new event-based execution model of distributed,
time-sensitive systems -- the "timed poset model." Posets provide the
most detailed formal basis to date for constructing early life cycle
prototyping tools, and later life cycle tools for correctness and
performance analysis of distributed time-sensitive systems.


<H3>Objectives</H3>

Rapide focuses on introducing new elements into industrial simulation
technology as incremental extensions of current tools and methods.

<H4>Specification Capabilities For EADLs</H4>

The Rapide specification language is planned to allow specification of
both constraints on concurrent patterns of events (posets) and
real-time constraints.  The associated support tools will provide
automated formal analysis (both proof theoretic and simulation
checking) of highly detailed properties of large-scale distributed
system architectures containing both hardware and software components.
We plan to utilize formal constraints in developing new techniques of
performance analysis of complex prototype systems.  

<H4>EADL-Based Formal Reference Architectures For Industrial Systems</H4>

We plan to define formal reference architectures for particular
industrial systems in Rapide (e.g., X/Open DTP and other industry
standards), analyze them formally for various critical properties,
(e.g., consistency, liveness, durability and real-time constraints),
and propose them as standard formal architecture definitions.  

<H4>Consistency Analysis Tools To Compare Architectures</H4>

Rapide support tools will include comparative simulation tools to
support consistency analysis between architectures. These tools will
enable an actual system to be executed and tested for conformance with
a formal reference architecture, thus providing a new technology for
industrial standardization.

<H4>Architectural Frameworks For Distributed, Multi-Lingual Systems.</H4>

A Rapide toolset is being developed to support the use of executable
architectures as frameworks for composing industrial-size systems that
contain components in different languages (e.g VHDL, Ada, C++, C,
Rapide) and can be executed on multiple workstations.

<H4>Formal Methods For EADLs</H4>

By defining formal mappings of other architecture formalisms (e.g.,
Honeywell's MetaH, VHDL, Verilog, LOTOS) into Rapide, we will develop
general techniques for defining formal semantics for domain specific
EADLs and a proof theory for component-based architectures in many
EADLs.


<H3>Rapide Language</H3>

<p>Rapide is a language framework consisting of (i) a type language, (ii)
an executable architecture definition language, (iii) a specification
language, and (iv) a concurrent reactive programming language.  The
architecture definition, specification and reactive programming
languages also share a pattern sublanguage that provides expressions
for reacting to and constraining event-based computations.  While
these languages satisfy certain compatibility requirements (e.g., they
have the same visibility, scoping and naming rules, and underlying
event-based execution model), the Rapide language framework is
designed to permit alternative programming or specification languages
to be used in conjunction with the type language.

<p>The <em>type language</em> is based on a single general interface type
construct together with inheritance derivations for building new
interfaces from existing ones.  The form of "derivation" provided
resembles inheritance mechanisms in object-oriented languages.  All
standard kinds of types (e.g., arrays, classes, task types) are
particular instances of interface types.  The type language is used to
define interfaces of components (both hardware and software) of a
system.


<p>The <em>architecture definition language</em> provides executable
features for composing systems out of component interfaces by defining
their synchronization and communication interconnections in terms of
patterns of events. These features provide powerful new constructs for
defining very large, possibly dynamic, architectures.  Moreover, event
pattern constructs are used to define mappings between architectures.
These EADL mappings are implementable to provide new tools for
automatically comparing system architectures at differing abstraction
levels in hierarchically designed systems, and for monitoring actual
systems for conformance with industry standard architectures.


<p>The <em>constraint language</em> provides constructs for abstract
specification of the behavior of a distributed system, including
timing requirements.  It is a constraint-based language, based on the
timed poset model, that supplies constructs for defining patterns of
events that are required (or forbidden) in the computation of a
distributed system.  Component interfaces and architectures may be
given detailed abstract specifications using the specification
language.


<p>The <em>executable language</em> is a concurrent reactive programming
language.  It uses types, objects, and expressions of the type
language, and provides module and control structures.  Its principal
constructs are independent (or concurrent) reactive processes that
activate when patterns of events occur during execution.  These
pattern-triggered processes are used (i) to define architecture
connections between components, and (ii) to construct behaviors of
components by rule-based, reactive programming techniques.  The
executable language also provides standard kinds of Algol-like control
structures, subprograms, exception raising and handling constructs,
and timing features.  Components may be assigned implementations
(modules) using either the Rapide reactive programming language, or
languages such as Ada, C++, or VHDL.
