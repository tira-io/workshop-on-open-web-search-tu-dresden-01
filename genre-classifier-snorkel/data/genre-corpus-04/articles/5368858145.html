The RDF Schema design and XML Schema design began independently, proposed common model where they fit together as interlocking pieces of the semantic web technology. Composite Capability/Preference Profiles (CC/PP): A user side framework for content negotiation W3C Note 27 July 1999 http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-CCPP/ In this note we describe a method for using RDF, the Resource Description Format of the W3C, to create a general, yet extensible framework for describing user preferences and device capabilities. This information can be provided by the user to servers and content providers. The servers can use this information describing the user's preferences to customize the service or content provided. The ability of RDF to reference profile information via URLs assists in minimizing the number of network transactions required to adapt content to a device, while the framework fits well into the current and future protocols being developed a the W3C and the WAP Forum. International Layout W3C Working Draft 26-July-1999 http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-i18n-format/ The following specification extends CSS to support East Asian and Bi-directional text formatting. Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) Specification W3C Working Draft 7 April 1999 http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-P3P/ This document describes the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P). P3P enables Web sites to express their privacy practices and enables users to exercise preferences over those practices. POIX: Point Of Interest eXchange Language Specification W3C Note - 24 June 1999 http://www.w3.org/TR/poix/ The "POIX" proposed here defines a general-purpose specification language for describing location information, which is an application of XML (Extensible Markup Language). POIX is a common baseline for exchanging location data via e-mail and embedding location data in HTML and XML documents. This specification can be used by mobile device developers, location-related service providers, and server software developers. Annotation of Web Content for Transcoding W3C Note 10 July 1999 http://www.w3.org/TR/annot/ This proposal presents annotations that can be attached to HTML/XML documents to guide their adaptation to the characteristics of diverse information appliances. It also provides a vocabulary for transcoding, and syntax of the language for annotating Web content. Used in conjunction with device capability information, style sheets, and other mechanisms, these annotations enable a high quality user experience for users who are accessing Web content from information appliances. XML Schema Part 1: Structures W3C Working Draft 6-May-1999 http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/ XML Schema: Structures is part one of a two part draft of the specification for the XML Schema definition language. This document proposes facilities for describing the structure and constraining the contents of XML 1.0 documents. The schema language, which is itself represented in XML 1.0, provides a superset of the capabilities found in XML 1.0 document type definitions (DTDs.). XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes World Wide Web Consortium Working Draft 06-May-1999 http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/ This document specifies a language for defining datatypes to be used in XML Schemas and, possibly, elsewhere. XHTML&amp;trade; 1.0: The Extensible HyperText Markup Language A Reformulation of HTML 4.0 in XML 1.0 W3C Working Draft 5th May 1999 http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/ This specification defines XHTML 1.0, a reformulation of HTML 4.0 as an XML 1.0 application, and three DTDs corresponding to the ones defined by HTML 4.0. The semantics of the elements and their attributes are defined in the W3C Recommendation for HTML 4.0. These semantics provide the foundation for future extensibility of XHTML. Compatibility with existing HTML user agents is possible by following a small set of guidelines. Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Specification Version 1.0 W3C Working Draft 19 July, 1999 This specification defines the Document Object Model Level 2, a platform- and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of documents. The Document Object Model Level 2 builds on the Document Object Model Level 1 ( http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1 ). This release of the Document Object Model Level 2 has all of the interfaces that the final version is expected to have. It contains interfaces for creating a document, importing a node from one document to another, supporting XML namespaces, associating stylesheets with a document, the Cascading Style Sheets object model, the Range object model, filters and iterators, and the Events object model. The DOM WG wants to get feedback on these, and especially on the two options presented for XML namespaces, so that final decisions can be made for the DOM Level 2 specification. IBM online XML education courses http://www2.software.ibm.com/developer/education.nsf/xml-onlinecourse-bytitle IETF Work: Common Indexing Protocol RFC 2651: The Architecture of the Common Indexing Protocol (CIP) J. Allen, M. Mealling ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2651.txt This document describes the CIP framework, including its architecture and the protocol specifics of exchanging indices. RFC 2652: MIME Object Definitions for the Common Indexing Protocol (CIP) J. Allen, M. Mealling ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2652.txt This document describes the definitions of those objects as well as the methods and requirements needed to define a new index type. RFC 2653: CIP Transport Protocols J. Allen, P. Leach, R. Hedberg ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2653.txt This document specifies three protocols for transporting CIP requests, responses and index objects, utilizing TCP, mail, and HTTP. RFC 2654: A Tagged Index Object for use in the Common Indexing Protocol R. Hedberg, B. Greenblatt, R. Moats, M. Wahl ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2654.txt This document defines a mechanism by which information servers can exchange indices of information from their databases by making use of the Common Indexing Protocol (CIP). This document defines the structure of the index information being exchanged, as well as the appropriate meanings for the headers that are defined in the Common Indexing Protocol. RFC 2655: CIP Index Object Format for SOIF Objects T. Hardie, M. Bowman, D. Hardy, M. Schwartz, D. Wessels ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2655.txt This document describes SOIF, the Summary Object Interchange Format, as an index object type in the context of the CIP framework. RFC 2656: Registration Procedures for SOIF Template Types T. Hardie ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2656.txt The registration procedure described in this document is specific to SOIF template types. RFC 2657: LDAPv2 Client vs. the Index Mesh R. Hedberg ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2657.txt LDAPv2 clients as implemented according to RFC 1777 have no notion on referral. The integration between such a client and an Index Mesh, as defined by the Common Indexing Protocol, heavily depends on referrals and therefore needs to be handled in a special way. This document defines one possible way of doing this. IETF work: other standards RFC: 2616. Hypertext Transfer Protocol - HTTP/1.1 R. Fielding, J. Gettys, J. Mogul, H. Frystyk, L. Masinter, P. Leach, T. Berners-Lee ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2616.txt HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 HTTP/1.0. LDAP Service Deployment BOF (lsd2) at IETF45 in Oslo http://www.ietf.org/ietf/99jul/lsd2-agenda-99jul.txt The purpose of this BOF is to examine the question of deploying LDAP services beyond the context of a single service provider. Presentations about TISDAG, NDD, DESIRE 2 Directory Service. Suggested areas of activity: description of service models for large-scale directory, schema recommendations (including i18n/l10n issues), client extensions. Technical Specification The Norwegian Directory of Directories (NDD) R.Hedberg, H.Alvestrand http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hedberg-alvestrand-ndd-00.txt This specification describs what is proposed to be the necessary infrastructure to provide a national directory server infrastructure in Norway for publicly accessible directory servers. Technical Infrastructure for Swedish Directory Access Gateways (TISDAG) Leslie Daigle, Roland Hedberg http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-daigle-tisdag-00.txt The strength of the TISDAG project's DAG proposal is that it defines the necessary technical infrastructure to provide a single-access-point service for information on Swedish Internet users. The resulting service will provide uniform access for all information -- the same level of access to information (7x24 service), and the same information made available, irrespective of the service provider responsible for maintaining that information, their directory service protocols, or the end-user's client access protocol. An Architecture for Integrated Directory Services Leslie Daigle, Thommy Eklof http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-daigle-arch-ids-00.txt Drawing from experiences with the TISDAG ([TISDAG]) project, this document outlines an approach to providing the necessary infrastructure for integrating such widely-scattered servers into a single service, rather than attempting to mandate a single protocol and schema set for all participating servers to use. The proposed architecture inserts a coordinated set of modules between the client access software and participating servers. While the client software interacts with the service at a single entry point, the remaining modules are called upon (behind the scenes) to provide the necessary application support. This may come in the form of modules that provide query proxying, schema translation, lookups, referrals, security infrastructure, etc. Use of Language Codes in LDAP M. Wahl, T. Howes ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2596.txt The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAPv3, RFC 2251) provides a means for clients to interrogate and modify information stored in a distributed directory system. The information in the directory is maintained as attributes (RFC 2252) of entries. Most of these attributes have syntaxes which are human-readable strings, and it is desirable to be able to indicate the natural language associated with attribute values. This document describes how language codes (RFC 1766) are carried in LDAP and are to be interpreted by LDAP servers. All implementations MUST be prepared to accept language codes in the LDAP protocols. Servers may or may not be capable of storing attributes with language codes in the directory. This document does not specify how to determine whether particular attributes can or cannot have language codes. Uniform Object Locator - UOL J. Boynton http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-boynton-uol-00.txt A Uniform Object Locator (UOL) provides a hierarchical "human-readable" format for describing the location of any single attribute within any data object. A UOL emulates the internal structure of a data object by dividing a partial URL into two re-usable components; An object constructor and an object name. The UOL format is particularly suited for retrieval and storage of parameter values through multiple object layers. Its basic construction allows it to be combined with a URL; without modification. Possible uses include distributed object management, XML, and e-business development. Context and Goals for Common Name Resolution Larry Masinter, Michael Mealling, Nicolas Popp, Karen Sollins http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-popp-cnrp-goals-00.txt This document establishes the context and goals for a Common Name Resolution Protocol. Internationalized Uniform Resource Identifiers (IURI), Larry Masinter, Martin Duerst http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-masinter-url-i18n-04.txt Tags for the Identification of Languages H. Alvestrand http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-alvestrand-lang-tags-v2-00.txt This document describes a language tag for use in cases where it is desired to indicate the language used in an information object. It also defines a Content-language: header, for use in the case where one desires to indicate the language of document. RFC 2611: URN Namespace Definition Mechanisms L. Daigle, D. van Gulik, R.

<br>W3C Note 27 July 1999
<br><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-CCPP/">http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-CCPP/</a>
<br>In this note we describe a method for using RDF, the Resource Description
Format of the W3C, to create a general, yet extensible framework for describing
user preferences and device capabilities. This information can be provided
by the user to servers and content providers. The servers can use this
information describing the user's preferences to customize the service
or content provided. The ability of RDF to reference profile information
via URLs assists in minimizing the number of network transactions required
to adapt content to a device, while the framework fits well into the current
and future protocols being developed a the W3C and the WAP Forum.

<br>W3C Working Draft 5th May 1999
<br><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/</a>
<br>This specification defines XHTML 1.0, a reformulation of HTML 4.0 as

<p>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Specification
<br>Version 1.0
<br>W3C Working Draft 19 July, 1999
<br>This specification defines the Document Object Model Level 2, a platform-
and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically
access and update the content, structure and style of documents. The Document
Object Model Level 2 builds on the Document Object Model Level 1 (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1</a>
).
<br>This release of the Document Object Model Level 2 has all of the interfaces
that the final version is expected to have. It contains interfaces for
creating a document, importing a node from one document to another, supporting
XML namespaces, associating stylesheets with a document, the Cascading
Style Sheets object model, the Range object model, filters and iterators,
and the Events object model. The DOM WG wants to get feedback on these,
and especially on the two options presented for XML namespaces, so that
final decisions can be made for the DOM Level 2 specification.

<br><a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2653.txt">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2653.txt</a>
<br>This document specifies three protocols for transporting CIP requests,
responses and index objects, utilizing TCP, mail, and HTTP.
<p>RFC 2654: A Tagged Index Object for use in the Common Indexing Protocol
<br>R. Hedberg, B. Greenblatt, R. Moats, M. Wahl
<br><a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2654.txt">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2654.txt</a>
<br>This document defines a mechanism by which information servers can
exchange indices of information from their databases by making use of the
Common Indexing Protocol (CIP). This document defines the structure of
the index information being exchanged, as well as the appropriate meanings
for the headers that are defined in the Common Indexing Protocol.
<p>RFC 2655: CIP Index Object Format for SOIF Objects
<br>T. Hardie, M. Bowman, D. Hardy, M. Schwartz, D. Wessels
<br><a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2655.txt">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2655.txt</a>
<br>This document describes SOIF, the Summary Object Interchange Format,
as an index object type in the context of the CIP framework.
<p>RFC 2656: Registration Procedures for SOIF Template Types
<br>T. Hardie
<br><a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2656.txt">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2656.txt</a>
<br>The registration procedure described in this document is specific to
SOIF template types.
<p>RFC 2657: LDAPv2 Client vs. the Index Mesh
<br>R. Hedberg
<br><a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2657.txt">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2657.txt</a>
<br>LDAPv2 clients as implemented according to RFC 1777 have no notion
on referral. The integration between such a client and an Index Mesh, as
defined by the Common Indexing Protocol, heavily depends on referrals and
therefore needs to be handled in a special way. This document defines one
possible way of doing this.

<p><a NAME="IETF.other"></a><b><font size=+1>IETF work: other standards</font></b>
<p>RFC: 2616. Hypertext Transfer Protocol - HTTP/1.1
<br>R. Fielding,&nbsp; J. Gettys, J. Mogul, H. Frystyk, L. Masinter, P.
Leach, T. Berners-Lee
<br><a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2616.txt">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2616.txt</a>
<br>HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information&nbsp;
initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol referred
to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 HTTP/1.0.

<p>LDAP Service Deployment BOF (lsd2) at IETF45 in Oslo
<br><a
href="http://www.ietf.org/ietf/99jul/lsd2-agenda-99jul.txt">http://www.ietf.org/ietf/99jul/lsd2-agenda-99jul.txt</a>
<br>The purpose of this BOF is to examine the question of deploying LDAP
 services beyond the context of a single service provider.
<br>Presentations about TISDAG, NDD, DESIRE 2 Directory Service.&nbsp;
Suggested areas of activity: description of service models for large-scale
directory, schema recommendations (including i18n/l10n issues), client
extensions.

<p>Technical Specification The Norwegian Directory of Directories (NDD)
<br>R.Hedberg, H.Alvestrand
<br><a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hedberg-alvestrand-ndd-00.txt">http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hedberg-alvestrand-ndd-00.txt</a>
<br>This specification describs what is proposed to be the necessary infrastructure
to provide a national directory server infrastructure in Norway for publicly
accessible directory servers.

<p>Technical Infrastructure for Swedish Directory Access Gateways (TISDAG)
<br>Leslie Daigle, Roland Hedberg
<br><a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-daigle-tisdag-00.txt">http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-daigle-tisdag-00.txt</a>
<br>The strength of the TISDAG project's DAG proposal is that it defines
the necessary technical infrastructure to provide a single-access-point
service for information on Swedish Internet users.&nbsp; The resulting
service will provide uniform access for all information -- the same level
of access to information (7x24 service), and the same information made
available, irrespective of the service provider responsible for maintaining
that information, their directory service protocols, or the end-user's
client access protocol.

<p>An Architecture for Integrated Directory Services
<br>Leslie Daigle, Thommy Eklof
<br><a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-daigle-arch-ids-00.txt">http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-daigle-arch-ids-00.txt</a>
<br>Drawing from experiences with the TISDAG ([TISDAG]) project, this document
outlines an approach to providing the necessary infrastructure for integrating
such widely-scattered servers into a single service, rather than attempting
to mandate a single protocol and schema set for all participating servers
to use.
<br>The proposed architecture inserts a coordinated set of modules between
the client access software and participating servers.&nbsp; While the client
software interacts with the service at a single entry point, the remaining
modules are called upon (behind the scenes) to provide the necessary application
support.&nbsp; This may come in the form of modules that provide query
proxying, schema translation, lookups, referrals, security infrastructure,
etc.

<p>Use of Language Codes in LDAP
<br>M. Wahl, T. Howes
<br><a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2596.txt">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2596.txt</a>
<br>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAPv3, RFC 2251) provides
a means for clients to interrogate and modify information stored in a distributed
directory system.&nbsp; The information in the directory is maintained
as attributes (RFC 2252) of entries.&nbsp; Most of these attributes have
syntaxes which are human-readable strings, and it is desirable to be able
to indicate the natural language associated with attribute values.
<br>This document describes how language codes (RFC 1766) are carried in
LDAP and are to be interpreted by LDAP servers.&nbsp; All implementations
MUST be prepared to accept language codes in the LDAP protocols.&nbsp;
Servers may or may not be capable of storing attributes with language codes
in the directory.&nbsp; This document does not specify how to determine
whether particular attributes can or cannot have language codes.

<p>Uniform Object Locator - UOL
<br>J. Boynton
<br><a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-boynton-uol-00.txt">http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-boynton-uol-00.txt</a>
<br>A Uniform Object Locator (UOL) provides a hierarchical "human-readable"
format for describing the location of any single attribute within any data
object. A UOL emulates the internal structure of a data object by dividing
a partial URL into two re-usable components; An object constructor and
an object name.
<br>The UOL format is particularly suited for retrieval and storage of
parameter values through multiple object layers. Its basic construction
allows it to be combined with a URL; without modification. Possible uses
include distributed object management, XML, and e-business development.
<p>Context and Goals for Common Name Resolution
<br>Larry Masinter, Michael Mealling, Nicolas Popp, Karen Sollins
<br><a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-popp-cnrp-goals-00.txt">http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-popp-cnrp-goals-00.txt</a>
<br>This document establishes the context and goals for a Common Name Resolution
Protocol.
<p>Internationalized Uniform Resource Identifiers (IURI),
<br>Larry Masinter, Martin Duerst
<br><a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-masinter-url-i18n-04.txt">http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-masinter-url-i18n-04.txt</a>
<p>Tags for the Identification of Languages
<br>H. Alvestrand
<br><a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-alvestrand-lang-tags-v2-00.txt">http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-alvestrand-lang-tags-v2-00.txt</a>
<br>This document describes a language tag for use in cases where it is
desired to indicate the language used in an information object. It also
defines a Content-language: header, for use in the case where one desires
to indicate the language of document.
