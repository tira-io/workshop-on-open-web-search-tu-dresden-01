 Adventure Racing and Adventure Races - MountainQuest Adventures Sri Lanka Adventure Quest...Come for the Competition and Experience a Journey of the Heart March 31 to April 4, 2004 We just returned from a Rekky in the mystical country of Sri Lanka - it is beyond fantastic. For more information on the race visit srilankaadventurequest.com Teams will experience the challenge of trekking cloud forest jungles and paddling fantastic whitewater. They'll see ancient and sacred caves, enjoy biking through mountain villages, and abseiling steep cliffs. Immersed in the rich culture and long history of the region teams will see why Marco Polo once called Sri Lanka "The best little island in the world". Race Format: 5 days of stage racing, 6 to 12 hours per day with one 24 hour stage. A limit of thirty coed teams of four will battle for over $ 50,000 in prize money. Winter Triathlon Continues Competitive Tradition Mike Kloser, trailing US National Snowshoe Champion Josiah Middaugh at the end of the run, made his move on the bike to snag first place in the Winter Triathlon race December 21st. He blasted the 3K Run - 8K Bike - 5K Ski course in 1:01:56. Pete Swenson was second (1:06:35), and Josiah (1:09) held on for a third place finish. Monique Merrill won the women's race in 1:21:09, with Amber Rydholm taking second place in 1:31:25. Ian Adamson, the consummate competitor, smilingly noted that the "Christmas pounds are causing my bike to sink in the snow". Join us for the next race in the series on February 8th.
