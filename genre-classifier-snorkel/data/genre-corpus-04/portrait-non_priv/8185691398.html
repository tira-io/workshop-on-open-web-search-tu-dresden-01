 Montreal SIMULA Site DIRO Simula home At the Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al, we recently ( 1994-1998 ) used Simula as the basic language to teach programming. This Web site was created at that time to help counteract the lack of information, software and support for the language. Since then, our department got overwhelmed by the Java Tidal Wave and Simula is only used peripherally. It is small consolation to us Simula fans that all students who were exposed to the language feel Simula would have been a much better base than C++ from which to develop "Java". [ Update - jan 2000; Now back to the original text ] We had been using Simula in simulation courses since 1970 when we found it bundled on our CDC computer. Simula was also used for the main case study in our advanced OS course. This case study, which involves writing an operating system for a simulated computer, has been with us for over 20 years. At the time, we thought Simula too exotic to use for basic programming; however, the recent OO craze (early 90's) made us re-evaluate OO languages (including Simula) for teaching. To our surprise, Simula turned out to be head and shoulders better than the competition in terms of simplicity, power, security and stability. To be fair, we should say that we did find it weak in 3 areas: availability of teaching material (books & cheap implementations), interactive graphics and popularity. Lately, thanks to the efforts of Bjorn Kirkerud and others in Oslo, the situation is being rectified: Kirkerud's text book, distributed by Addison-Wesley, is widely available, his WindowTools Class allows use of GUIs in beginners' programs and the CIM compiler ( SIMULA in C ) means that anyone can teach and program in Simula. A port of CIM to the Windows environment is also available. This Simula Home site is designed to help on the teaching & popularity front by providing (eventually) a complete on-line reference as well as useful Web Pointers and access to Simula application software. Presently, the most significant information here is a complete set of syntax graphs that we have generated from the BNF rules. Jean G.
