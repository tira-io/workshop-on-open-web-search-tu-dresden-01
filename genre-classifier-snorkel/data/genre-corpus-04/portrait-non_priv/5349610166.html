 InsBanc: Banks and Insurance Bring Some Life to Your Bank! Now that restrictive barriers have lessened, financial institutions are rapidly becoming the fastest growing distribution channel in America for insurance products. During the past two years, considerable deregulation has occurred in the banking industry. This deregulation permits banks to become directly involved in the sale and distribution of life insurance products to their customers. While financial institutions now have the legal authority to do this, many banks lack the infrastructure and expertise to convert leads to sales and deliver life insurance products on a cost-efficient basis. InsBanc provides the market segmentation strategy, the products, the agent network and the tracking technology necessary for a comprehensive life insurance distribution program. This is a unique concept &#150; which harnesses the power of customer relationships and enables the bank to profit from the sale of insurance products &#150; without necessitating capital outlay or human resources. Through the InsBanc program, participating financial institutions can effectively realize a wealth of potential provided by thousands of leads generated through daily transactions like mortgage loans, credit lines, commercial loans, etc. Providing for the insurance needs of these customers through InsBanc enables the bank to generate an immediate revenue stream, while at the same time rendering the highest quality products and service standards. Market Potential They walk in and out of banks every day. They apply for mortgages, make business loans, purchase investments. They make up the largest segment of the American population and constitute a major portion of the bank&#146;s customer base. This is the middle America market. These customers represent a growing market segment that needs and wants to purchase life insurance products that will guarantee their financial security. They feel confident working through their financial institution and will readily listen to the recommendations made by a trusted insurance counselor. Many of these customers consist of young families with growing children -- families that need affordable life insurance. &#149; The 1995 Kehrer study indicates that insurance production through banks is on the verge of tremendous growth with the focus on new distribution strategies and products directed to an under-served market. &#149; The middle market customer is considered to be the most under-served by the insurance industry today and offers the greatest sales potential for bank insurance distribution. &#149; 97 percent of the people who purchase life insurance also have a checking account. Other Facts to Consider &#149; 22 percent of all households and 40 percent of all Americans have no life insurance coverage. Fifty percent who do have coverage are underinsured. &#149; The broader the sale of insurance to the general public, the more capital is invested to create more wealth, expand the economy and create more jobs and a greater need for life insurance. &#149; Today, there is one career insurance agent for every 400 households, leaving a vast number of Americans underserved in the life insurance market. &#149; More than half of the American people may buy insurance from their bank. Why? Because it is being offered to them by their bank and because people trust their banking institutions and probably have had a business relationship with their bank for many years. &#149; Recent studies have indicated that 30-50 percent of middle market consumers would prefer to discuss their insurance needs with a bank-affiliated representative. How InsBanc Can Help Your Bank &quot;The future success of banks in insurance will be contingent upon an ability to provide skilled agent services to America's middle market consumers.&quot; InsBanc is a company dedicated to helping financial institutions meet the challenge of today's changing marketplace.
