 Frequently Asked Questions about CalendarsVersion 2.6 Next: Contents Frequently Asked Questions about Calendars Version 2.6 Claus T&#248;ndering 24 June 2003 URL: http://www.tondering.dk/claus/calendar.html Copyright and disclaimer This document is Copyright &#169;2003 by Claus T&#248;ndering. E-mail: claus@tondering.dk. The document may be freely distributed, provided this copyright notice is included and no money is charged for the document. This document is provided ``as is''. No warranties are made as to its correctness. Introduction This is the calendar FAQ. Its purpose is to give an overview of the Christian, Hebrew, Persian, and Islamic calendars in common use. It will provide a historical background for the Christian calendar, plus an overview of the French Revolutionary calendar, the Maya calendar, and the Chinese calendar. Comments are very welcome. My e-mail address is given above. I would like to thank Dr Monzur Ahmed of the University of Birmingham, UK, Michael J Appel, Jay Ball, Tom Box, Chris Carrier, Simon Cassidy, Claus Dobesch, Leofranc Holford-Strevens, David B. Kelley of the Hamamatsu University School of Medicine in Japan, H. Koenig, Graham Lewis, Duncan MacGregor, Marcos Montes, James E. Morrison, Waleed A. Muhanna of the Fisher College of Business, Columbus, Ohio, USA, Stefan Potthast, Yves Sagnier of the Centre d'Etudes de la Navigation Aerienne, Paul Schlyter of the Swedish Amateur Astronomer's Society, Dr John Stockton for their help with this document. Changes in version 2.6 The names for the six additional days of the French revolutionary calendar have been corrected. A few minor corrections have been made. Changes in version 2.5 A new section 2.12.4 has been added and the following sections renumbered. The description of the calculation of the Epact in section 2.12.5 has been rewritten. Chapter 5 about the Persian calendar has been added and the following chapters renumbered. Section 10.5 now mentions a couple of calendar books. A few minor corrections have been made. Writing dates and years Dates will be written in the British format (1 January) rather than the American format (January 1). Dates will occasionally be abbreviated: ``1 Jan'' rather than ``1 January''. Years before and after the ``official'' birth year of Christ will be written ``45 BC'' or ``AD 1997'', respectively. I prefer this notation over the secular ``45 BCE'' and ``1997 CE'' (See also section 2.13.4 .) The `mod' operator Throughout this document the operator `mod' will be used to signify the modulo or remainder operator. For example, 17 mod 7 = 3 because the result of the division 17/7 is 2 with a remainder of 3. The text in square brackets Square brackets [like this] identify information that I am unsure about and about which I would like more information.

Throughout this document the operator `mod' will be used to
        signify the modulo or remainder operator. For example,
        17 mod 7 = 3 because the result of the division 17/7 is 2 with a
