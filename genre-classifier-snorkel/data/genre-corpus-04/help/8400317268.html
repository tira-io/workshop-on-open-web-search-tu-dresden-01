GENERAL QUESTIONS 1.1 What is LDAP? LDAP is a client-server protocol for accessing a directory service. It was initially used as a front-end to X.500, but can also be used with stand-alone and other kinds of directory servers. 1.2 Why do we need LDAP? Why don't we just use X.500? LDAP does not require the upper layers OSI stack, it is a simpler protocol to implement (especially in clients), and LDAP is under IETF change control and so can more easily evolve to meet Internet requirements. 1.3 What are some related protocols or alternatives to LDAP? WHOIS++ is a simple text-based query protocol which can be used to construct a distributed directory for white pages information. It is described in RFC 1835 and is discussed on the ietf-wnils@ucdavis.edu mailing list. The Common Indexing Protocol (CIP) is a means of exchanging general index information between attribute-value based directory services, such as WHOIS++ and LDAP. It was discussed in the IETF FIND Working Group . 1.4 Where can I find out more about LDAP? Try the LDAP World pages at Innosoft International, Inc. , or Jeff Hodges's LDAP Road Map and FAQ , or at University of Michigan . 1.5 Where can I find out more about X.500? One reference is Colin Robbin's Directory page at NEXOR . 1.6 Where are there publically-accessible LDAP servers for NameFLOW-Paradise ? See DANTE's list of public directory interfaces . 1.7 What can I store in an LDAP directory? The LDAP information model is based on the entry, which contains information about some object (e.g., a person). Entries are composed of attributes, which have a type and one or move values. Each attribute has a syntax that determines what kind of values are allowed in the attribute and how those values behave during directory operations. Examples of attribute syntaxes are for IA5 (ASCII) strings, JPEG photographs, u-law encoded sounds, URLs and PGP keys. 1.8 How should I structure my LDAP directory? RFC 1617 discusses naming and structuring guidelines for X.500 Directory pilots, and much of this is applicable to LDAP as well. 2. PROTOCOL QUESTIONS 2.1 What is the current version of LDAP (protocol)? Most existing clients and servers only implement version 2 of the LDAP protocol, which was specified in RFC 1777 , RFC 1778 , and RFC 1779 . These documents were obsoleted by LDAP version 3. The document for LDAPv3 can be downloaded from the LDAPv3 page . Note that early LDAP releases (before 3.3) from the University of Michigan mis-set tags in its BER encodings. See question 4.9 below. 2.2 Can certificates and CRLs be carried in LDAP? Though there are syntaxes defined for certificates and revocation lists, there are two problems which prevent these from being used in LDAPv2. The first is that the string representation of distinguished names used for DNs inside a certificate does not give an indication of whether the name was in the PrintableString or TeletexString character set. Because of this ambiguity, it is not always possible for a client to correctly reconstruct the DER form of the certificate or revocation list in order to verify its signature. The second problem is that the syntaxes are based on the X.509(1988) definitions, whereas most new implementations today are following the post-1993 addendums to X.509, which permit certificate and CRL extensions. These issues have been considered in the design of LDAPv3: LDAPv3 permits clients to retrieve the DER-encoded form of these attributes. 2.3 What character set is used in LDAP? In LDAPv2, strings such as the values of the cn or description attributes are in the T.61 character set, which is published as an ITU-T Recommendation . In LDAPv3, strings are used in the UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode character set. 2.4 Can I remove multiple entries at once? No, the Delete operation will only remove a single entry, and it does not remove non-leaf entries which have subordinates. 2.5 Can I search on components of the entry's name? Not in LDAPv2. However, this is permitted in LDAPv3 3. IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS 3.1 What are all the implementations of LDAP? A list of clients, servers, gateways, libraries, backends, etc., is available at this site . 3.2 Is there an example of using the client API (RFC 1823)? It's used in the finger code, the gopher code, and probably some other code in the Umich ldap distribution. Take a look at finger/main.c, for example. 3.3 Does a whois-to-LDAP gateway exist? Mark Prior wrote a whois++ to LDAP gateway a couple of years ago. It's included in the ldap-3.2 release under contrib/whois++/. Mark admits that it is kind of out-of-date at this point, and may not even build as far as I know, but you might start with that, at least. -- Tim Sylvain Langlois comments: I'm working on a whois++ to LDAP gateway. It's based on the latest Uof Mich LDAP version. The major difference is that I'm using CIP instead of proprietary indexing protocol of the release. 3.4 Does a Ph-to-LDAP gateway exist? There may be one developed at Umea Universitet in Sweden. Also, from Eudora at ftp://ftp.eudora.com/eudora/servers/unix/ph2ldap/ph2ldap_1.0B3.tar . 3.5 Does a HTTP-to-LDAP gateway exist? Frank Richter has written a gateway called web500gw . For more information see http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~fri/web500gw/ . 3.6 Does an LDAP-to-X.500 gateway exist? ldapd is included in the Umich release. 3.7 Can I connect a stand-alone LDAP directory server into an X.500 directory? Yes! See for example the X.500 Enabler . 3.8 Why do some searches return neither results nor an error indication? Some filter component may be illegal (such as mistaking country name for common name: country names are restricted to being exactly two characters long). 3.9 Is the common name attribute "CN" or "commonName"? The shorter name should be used. This was being clarified in the spec for LDAPv3. 4. UMICH-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS 4.1 What is the current version of LDAP (Umich implementation)? The most recent is release 3.3 of April 30,1996. The announcement is available from University of Michigan . There is a collection of patches which bring this up to SLAPD 3.3.1 available here . 4.2 Where can I find out more about this code or report bugs? There is a discussion list relating to this implementation, ldap@umich.edu . To join contact ldap-request@umich.edu . 4.3 Where can I FTP the Umich code? The primary distribution point of U-M LDAP 3.3 is ftp://terminator.rs.itd.umich.edu/ldap/ldap-3.3.tar.Z . See http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/ldap/ for a list of mirror sites. 4.4 Where are the "quipu" include files? You need to get the ISODE package. The last public version of ISODE, ISODE 8, can be obtained from a number of anonymous FTP sites, such as ftp://ftp.uu.net/networking/osi/isode/ , but is several years out of date, contains numerous bugs and is unsupported. The ISODE stack and applications are now maintained by ISODE Inc , who may be contacted at ic-info@isode.com . 4.5 I have unresolved references such as "ufn_init" when using ISODE 8. Try specifying the libraries in a different order when invoking the linker. . 4.6 Problem with "errno" when compiling with DB 1.85 on Solaris. There is a patch in LDAP 3.3 build/db.1.85.patch which needs to be applied to DB 1.85. 4.7 slapd seg faults on AIX. With some AIX compilers char defaults to unsigned char which can cause serious problems with the AVL tree routines. This can be worked around by changing line 24 of include/avl.h to read signed char avl_bf . 4.8 I am using NDBM and strange things are happening... For example, when adding entries with either ldif2ldbm or ldapadd, I get the error "idl_insert_key: No space left on device". NDBM is severely limiting on Solaris and most other platforms and should not be used in servers. Alternatives include the Berkeley database package and GDBM. Version 1.85 of the Berkeley hash and btree package can be obtained from ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/4bsd/db.1.85.tar.Z . The hash implementation in 1.85 limits a single level or index to approximately 8000 entries. This restriction will be removed in db 2.0, which is currently in alpha test. GDBM can be obtained from the Free Software Foundation at prep.ai.mit.edu or other FSF mirror sites. See section 4 of the SLAPD and SLURPD Administrator's Guide for information on how to build with GDBM or Berkeley DB. Note: if you change database definitions in the top level Make-common file, be certain to do a "make veryclean" at the top level of the distribution before rebuilding. If you don't, it is likely that you'll end up with some half-ndbm build which won't work. 4.9 Why do I get a "decoding error" when trying a simple bind against someone elses server? The server is based on an early Umich release which miscalculated tags. 4.10 Does ldapd support aliases? Yes, so long as the X.500 Directory implementation supports them (which most do). 4.11 Does slapd support aliases? No. 4.12 Is there a [your database vendor] backend for slapd ? There have not yet been any public releases of additional backends for slapd , though there are several people working on them. 4.13 Does slapd run under Windows NT? The publically available Umich 3.3 servers don't support the Win32 API. SLAPD has been ported by NorTel and is available from here . 4.14 Does ldapd cache entries? The University of Michigan release of ldapd does not. ISODE Consortium added caching support in its IC R3. 4.15 Why can't I remove an entry from slapd once I have removed all its children? There is a known problem with slapd not updating one of its indexes properly on the delete (the one that says whether an entry has children or not). The problem will go away if you regenerate your indexes from an ldif file. 4.16 Strange file names in db directory Q: I originally build the distrubtion with ndbm, then switched to Berkeley DB (or GDBM). Now, the filenames in the db directory end with ".ndbm.dbb" (or ".ndbm.gdbm" or some other strange combination of suffixes). Slapd can't find any entries I've added. A: Go to the top of the ldap source tree and edit "Make-common". Be sure that there is only one LDBMBACKEND definition. Then, do a "make veryclean" followed by a "make install". 4.17 Who is Babs Jensen? See the Martha Smith entry . LDAP World Comments on this document may be sent to Mark Wahl .

	    <dl> 
	      <dt>4.1 What is the current version of LDAP (Umich implementation)? 
	      <dd> 
		<p>The most recent is release 3.3 of April 30,1996. The announcement 
		  is available from <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~dirsvcs/ldap/index.html">University 
		  of Michigan</a>.</p>
		<p>There is a collection of patches which bring this up to SLAPD 
		  3.3.1 <a href="/ldapworld/patch/">available here</a>.</p>
	      <dt>4.2 Where can I find out more about this code or report bugs? 
	      <dd> 
		<p>There is a discussion list relating to this implementation, 
		  <tt>ldap@umich.edu</tt>. To join contact <tt><a href="mailto:ldap-request@umich.edu">ldap-request@umich.edu</a></tt>.</p>
	      <dt>4.3 Where can I FTP the Umich code? 
	      <dd> 
		<p> The primary distribution point of U-M LDAP 3.3 is <tt><a href="ftp://terminator.rs.itd.umich.edu/ldap/ldap-3.3.tar.Z">ftp://terminator.rs.itd.umich.edu/ldap/ldap-3.3.tar.Z</a></tt>. 
		<p>See <tt><a href="http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/ldap/">http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/ldap/</a></tt> 
		  for a list of mirror sites.</p>
	      <dt>4.4 Where are the "quipu" include files? 
	      <dd> 
		<p> You need to get the ISODE package. The last public version 
		  of ISODE, ISODE 8, can be obtained from a number of anonymous 
		  FTP sites, such as <tt><a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/networking/osi/isode/">ftp://ftp.uu.net/networking/osi/isode/</a></tt>, 
		  but is several years out of date, contains numerous bugs and 
		  is unsupported. The ISODE stack and applications are now maintained 
		  by <a href="http://www.isode.com/">ISODE Inc</a>, who may be 
		  contacted at <tt><a href="mailto:ic-info@isode.com">ic-info@isode.com</a></tt>.</p>
	      <dt>4.5 I have unresolved references such as "ufn_init" when using 
		ISODE 8. 
	      <dd> 
		<p> Try specifying the libraries in a different order when invoking 
		  the linker.</p>
		. 
	      <dt>4.6 Problem with "errno" when compiling with DB 1.85 on Solaris. 
	      <dd> 
		<p>There is a patch in LDAP 3.3 <tt>build/db.1.85.patch</tt> which 
		  needs to be applied to DB 1.85.</p>
	      <dt>4.7 <b>slapd</b> seg faults on AIX. 
	      <dd> 
		<p> With some AIX compilers <tt>char</tt> defaults to <tt>unsigned 
		  char</tt> which can cause serious problems with the AVL tree 
		  routines. This can be worked around by changing line 24 of <tt>include/avl.h</tt> 
		  to read <tt>signed char avl_bf</tt>. </p>
	      <dt>4.8 I am using NDBM and strange things are happening... 
	      <dd> 
		<p>For example, when adding entries with either ldif2ldbm or ldapadd, 
		  I get the error "idl_insert_key: No space left on device". </p>
		<p>NDBM is severely limiting on Solaris and most other platforms 
		  and should not be used in servers. Alternatives include the 
		  Berkeley database package and GDBM.</p>
		<p> Version 1.85 of the Berkeley hash and btree package can be 
		  obtained from <tt><a href="ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/4bsd/db.1.85.tar.Z"> 
		  ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/4bsd/db.1.85.tar.Z</a></tt>. The 
		  hash implementation in 1.85 limits a single level or index to 
		  approximately 8000 entries. This restriction will be removed 
		  in db 2.0, which is currently in alpha test.</p>
		<p> GDBM can be obtained from the Free Software Foundation at 
		  <tt><a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/">prep.ai.mit.edu</a></tt> 
		  or other FSF mirror sites.</p>
		<p>See section 4 of the SLAPD and SLURPD Administrator's Guide 
		  for information on how to build with GDBM or Berkeley DB.</p>
		<p>Note: if you change database definitions in the top level <tt>Make-common</tt> 
		  file, <b>be certain</b> to do a "make veryclean" at the top 
		  level of the distribution before rebuilding. If you don't, it 
		  is likely that you'll end up with some half-ndbm build which 
		  won't work.</p>
	      <dt>4.9 Why do I get a "decoding error" when trying a simple bind 
		against someone elses server? 
	      <dd> 
		<p> The server is based on an early Umich release which miscalculated 
		  tags. </p>
	      <dt>4.10 Does <b>ldapd</b> support aliases? 
	      <dd> 
		<p>Yes, so long as the X.500 Directory implementation supports 
		  them (which most do).</p>
	      <dt>4.11 Does <b>slapd</b> support aliases? 
	      <dd> 
		<p>No.</p>
	      <dt>4.12 Is there a [your database vendor] backend for <b>slapd</b>? 
	      <dd> 
		<p>There have not yet been any public releases of additional backends 
		  for <b>slapd</b>, though there are several people working on 
		  them.</p>
	      <dt>4.13 Does <b>slapd</b> run under Windows NT? 
	      <dd> 
		<p>The publically available Umich 3.3 servers don't support the 
		  Win32 API. <b>SLAPD</b> has been ported by NorTel and is available 
		  <a href="/ldapworld/patch/">from here</a>.</p>
	      <dt>4.14 Does <b>ldapd</b> cache entries? 
	      <dd> 
		<p>The University of Michigan release of <b>ldapd</b> does not. 
		  ISODE Consortium added caching support in its IC R3.</p>
	      <dt>4.15 Why can't I remove an entry from <b>slapd</b> once I have 
		removed all its children? 
	      <dd> 
		<p>There is a known problem with slapd not updating one of its 
		  indexes properly on the delete (the one that says whether an 
		  entry has children or not). The problem will go away if you 
		  regenerate your indexes from an ldif file.</p>
	      <dt>4.16 Strange file names in db directory 
	      <dd> 
		<p>Q: I originally build the distrubtion with ndbm, then switched 
		  to Berkeley DB (or GDBM). Now, the filenames in the db directory 
		  end with ".ndbm.dbb" (or ".ndbm.gdbm" or some other strange 
		  combination of suffixes). <b>Slapd</b> can't find any entries 
		  I've added.</p>
		<p>A: Go to the top of the ldap source tree and edit "Make-common". 
		  Be sure that there is only one <tt>LDBMBACKEND</tt> definition. 
		  Then, do a "make veryclean" followed by a "make install".</p>
