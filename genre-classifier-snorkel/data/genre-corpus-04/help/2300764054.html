Where the FAQ mentions &quot;Solaris 2.x&quot;, it really refers to Solaris 2.x, Solaris 7 and later. You can help make it an even better-quality FAQ by writing a short contribution or update and sending it BY EMAIL ONLY to me. A contribution should consist of a question and an answer, and increasing number of people sends me contributions of the form &quot;I don't know the answer to this, but it must be a FAQ, please answer it for me&quot;; please don't send me those.

<P>
The following is a list of questions that are frequently asked about
Solaris 2.x and later.  Where the FAQ mentions &quot;Solaris 2.x&quot;, it
really refers to Solaris 2.x, Solaris 7 and later.
<P>
You can help make it an even better-quality FAQ by writing a short
contribution or update and sending it BY EMAIL ONLY to me.  A
contribution should consist of a question and an answer, and increasing
number of people sends me contributions of the form &quot;I don't know the
answer to this, but it must be a FAQ, please answer it for me&quot;; please
don't send me those.
<P>
Thanks!

As you may have noted, I have switched employers and work for Sun as of
