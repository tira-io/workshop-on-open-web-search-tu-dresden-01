Subbarao Kambhampati (Rao) was born a long long time ago in Peddapuram in Andhra Pradesh, India. After formative education at "the school next to Cinema Hall" (where he liked the teacher of the 1st grade so much that he stayed in that class for 2nd and 3rd grades too), the "School behind Anjaneyaswamy Temple" (which has since been demolished to make way for a sweet stall), Sri Veeraraju High School (S.V. Highschool), and Sri Raja Vatsavaayi Buchchi Seetayamma Jagapati Bahaddur Maharanee College (S.R.V.B.S.J.B.M.R. College, no less!), he survived JEE and did his Bachelors in Electrical Engineering (Electronics!--although he still couldn't repair the tape recorder to his father's satisfaction) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras . Continuing along his degree grabbing spree, he landed a Masters and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park. After a brief post-doctoral stint at Stanford , Rao has been having a blast crawling up the faculty hierarchy in the Computer Science department at ASU since 1991. He started as a quarter professor, became a half Professor in 1996 and a FULL (!) Professor in 2000. His current goal is to become two professors by 2004. Rao directs the Yochan research group at ASU. His current research interests are in automated planning (including scheduling, CSP), and information integration on the Internet. He is the recipient of a 1994 NSF young investigator award. He was an invited speaker at AAAI 1996 and ICAPS 2003. He also gave a couple of well received tutorials on planning and databases, the most recent ones being on automated planning (AAAI-2000) , and information integration on the web (AAAI-2002) He is currently particularly tickled about landing a 2001-2002 College of Engineering teaching excellence award . Click here for further biographical information. Here is a detailed CV in pdf, and here is a teaching and research statement (circa late 2002) Professional service: Rao co-chaired the 2000 AI Planning and Scheduling (AIPS) Conference , sits on the exalted ICAPS executive committee, and regularly serves on the program committtees of various conferences in AI, planning, automated manufacturing and databases. Recently, he has been on the program committees of SIGMOD-2000, AAAI-2000, ECP-2001, AIPS-2002 and AAAI-2002. Worried that he might be stuck with free time, he already signed himself up for KBCS-2002, ICAPS-2003 and AAMAS-2003 PCs for this year, in addition to co-chairing the IJCAI I3 workshop Publications: Here are online versions of my publications.
