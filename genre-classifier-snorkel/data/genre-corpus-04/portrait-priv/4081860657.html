 Douglas N. Arnold Douglas N. Arnold Since 2001 I have held the position of Director of the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications in Minneapolis and Professor of Mathematics at the University of Minnesota. My research mostly concerns numerical analysis, partial differential equations, mechanics, and in particular, the interplay between these fields. Recently much of my effort has been directed toward the numerical solution of the equations of general relativity.
