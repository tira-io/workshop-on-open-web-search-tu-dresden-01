<H3>Research overview</H3>

I'm interested in computational foundations of intelligent
sensing, reasoning, and action---with a particular focus on methods for grappling with incompleteness
in representations and uncertainty about environments or situations. 
Much of my work centers on harnessing probability and decision
theory, decision analysis, and, in particular, the use of Bayesian and
<A HREF="dt.htm">decision-theoretic principles</a> in the construction
and operation of intelligent, flexible computer-based reasoning
systems. 
My interests and research span both <A
HREF="http://www.research.microsoft.com/~horvitz/abstracts.htm">theoretical
issues</A> and concrete, <A HREF="real.htm"> real-world
applications</A>, including systems for performing diagnosis and for
prescribing ideal action for <A HREF="vista.htm">user interfaces</a>,
operating systems, <A href="qa-dt.htm">information retrieval</a>, machine repair, and
communications.  
I've been interested in methods and languages for <a href="ccfetch.htm">guiding computer actions</a> in accordance with the preferences and goals of people, and on principles of <A HREF="mixedinit.htm"> mixed-initiative interaction</a> that can support fluid, efficient <a href="umdl.htm">collaborations</a> between people and computing systems. Other interests include <a href="cacm-attention.htm">information triage and alerting</a>, spanning work on <a href="attend.htm">notification systems</a> and psychological <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~horvitz/interrupt.htm">studies of disruption</a>. I've also been long interested in offline and real-time optimization of the <a href="cornell_meeting_reflections.htm">expected value of
computational systems</a> under limited and varying resources.  Areas of concentration in this realm include 
<A HREF="flex.htm">flexible computation</A>, ideal <A
HREF="http://www.research.microsoft.com/~horvitz/reflect.htm">metareasoning</A>
for guiding computation, <A

for reducing real-time deliberation, <a href="ccprinciples.htm">continual computation</a>, and the construction of <A
