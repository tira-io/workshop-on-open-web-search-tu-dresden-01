 Peter Szolovits Photo by Philip Greenspun Peter Szolovits is Professor of Computer Science and Engineering in the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and head of the Clinical Decision-Making Group within the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science . His research centers on the application of AI methods to problems of medical decision making and design of information systems for health care institutions and patients. He has worked on problems of diagnosis, therapy planning, execution and monitoring for various medical conditions, computational aspects of genetic counseling, controlled sharing of health information, and privacy and confidentiality issues in medical record systems. His interests in AI include knowledge representation, qualitative reasoning, and probabilistic inference. His interests in medical computing include Web-based heterogeneous medical record systems, life-long personal health information systems, and design of cryptographic schemes for health identifiers. He teaches classes in artificial intelligence, programming languages, medical computing, medical desision making, knowledge-based systems and probabilistic inference. Prof. Szolovits is on the editorial board of several journals, has served as program chairman and on the program committees of national conferences, and has been a founder of and consultant for several companies that apply AI to problems of commercial interest. Prof. Szolovits is a Fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence and of the American College of Medical Informatics.
