<b> Brief Personal History </b>
<hr>
<p>
I was born in London, Ontario (Canada) but most of my growing up
was spent in Ottawa, Ontario (Canada).  After graduating from
high school, I attended the University of Waterloo for an entire
month before deciding that I needed some time away from school.
I spent the next two years doing everything from running a
computer consulting company to manual labour.  Finally, I ended
up working as an accounts payable clerk at Revenue Canada.  It
seems that this gave me sufficient motivation to return to school
and so I did.
<p>
Not being deterred by having failed once, I returned once again
to the University of Waterloo where I stayed for 5 years.
Finally, in August of 1998 I finished my last course and
graduated with a <i> B.Math (Honours Computer Science) </i>
degree.
<p>
After that, I moved to the U.S. to go to graduate school.  I
received my M.S. from Carnegie Mellon in December, 2000 and
am still working ever so slowly toward the Ph.D.
<p>
If you want to see what I look like, you can see Carrie and I dressed
for <a href=pictures/halloween.html> Halloween </a> or you can see us
dressed for a <a href=pictures/wedding.jpg> wedding.</a>  Slightly
more recently, you can see pictures of us with her sister's
<a href=pictures/martini.html> little-bitty puppy. </a>

<b> My Schooling </b>
<hr>
<p>
As I said, I'm a PhD student at CMU (in my third year).  My advisor is
<a href=//www.cs.cmu.edu/~christos/> Christos Faloutsos </a>.  The
first work I did here was some research into clustering algorithms that
can handle very large databases (many gigabytes or terabytes of data)
with high dimensional data (hundreds or thousands of dimensions).
<p>
Since then, I have done so research into network topologies (trying
to understand more about what the Internet and the Web look like,
as a graph).  I've worked on an approximation to the neighbourhood
function and I'm working on some ideas for similarity in data bases
containing categorical data.
<p>
For fun, I also work with <a href=http://www.vivisimo.com/> Vivisimo </a>,
a CMU start up.  I did some work with them at CMU which in part lead
to the founding of the company.

<b> Research Interests </b>
<hr>
<p>
My research interests are quite varied.  Right now they are mostly
surrounding applications of graphs to data mining and text clustering.
In my past lives, I have done some sampling work, text data base work,
a hybrid text/relational data base (combining SQL and full text search)
as well as some groupware research.
<p>
You can find pointers to this work in my <a href=pubs.html> publications </a>.
<p>
I also find graph algorithms to be very interesting.  At one point,
I wrote a little description of <a href=sp> Dijkstra's algorithm</a>
(single source shortest path) and there is some source code available.
<p>
<hr>
<b> Other Interests </b>
<hr>
<p>
My main hobbies are hiking, climbing and beer brewing.  I currently
hike in Pennsylvania but plan to try some trails in West Virginia
when the weather warms up.  I have only climbed in the real world
a couple of times because I took up the hobby late in the fall.
<p>
Before coming to CMU, my main hobby was canoeing and camping.
There are two major parks in Ontario that have serious canoe routes.
They are
  <a href=http://www.ontarioparks.com/algo.htm> Algonquin Park</a>
and
  <a href=http://www.ontarioparks.com/kill.html> Killarney Park</a>.
During the summer of 1998 I took two nine day <a href=algonquin>trips</a>
into Algonquin Park.  So far, I've managed to find time for one
trip in the summer of 1999.  I hope to visit Killarney sometime as it is
supposed to have beautiful cliffs.
<p>
Beyond that, I enjoy many typical student activities such as playing
pool, hanging out in bars and generally not taking life too seriously.
I even tune out the world every now and again and watch some TV,
much easier with a <a href=tvguide> TV Guide</a>.
<p>
Finally, I used to work on tile-based adventure games.  These are games such
as the old Ultima series and King Quest series.  I wrote an explanation
of
<a href=sp/>
  Dijkstra's algorithm
</a>
(source code is available) and I derived a very simple method of doing
<a href=text/displayable.full>
  field of vision testing
</a>
(
<a href=text/displayable.c>
  displayable.c
</a>
) for games like the Ultima series (when the screen is relatively small).
