 Private Homepage Of Michael Tippach Welcome to the wonderful world of Michael Tippach a.k.a. "Wuschel"! Boredom guaranteed! Why do people have homepages anyway? And: Yes, the guy on the left with that psychotic look - this is supposed to be my humble self, at the tender age of 35. So what have I been up to so far? Born on December 28, 1965 in Leipzig, former German Democratic Republic. That was a tough one - took me 19 hours to get out! Attended primary school in 1972, became a daydreamer and a bully magnet. Attended extended secondary school from 1980 to 1984, A- Level in 1984 1984 - 1987 military service in the East German air force. 1987 - 1992 I've been busy pretending to study while enjoying student life - at the Technical University in Chemnitz, former "Karl Marx Stadt". Degree in Electrical Engineering in 1992. 1992 - 1993 I've been working for a Bulgarian telephone comapny as a technical supervisor. 1993 - 1997 I have been self employed doing all kinds of stuff in the IT sector. 1997 I decided I need a change and moved to Surrey/England, working for Phoenix Technologies as a senior BIOS engineer. Got used to Sainsbury's Baked Beans and beer without a head, pubs closing at a time when otherwise I would have just started to consider going out, driving on the left side of the road - and last but not least that weird British accent. 1999 I decided I need another change and let the company move me back to Germany, living in Utting am Ammersee and working for Phoenix Technologies in Munich, as a senior BIOS engineer, as you would have guessed already. 2000 I decided I need yet another change and took on an offer from Fujitsu- Siemens Computers in Augsburg to work there - as a BIOS engineer. 2001 Most recent change: I moved from Utting to Augsburg and decided to put together a homepage - There we are! [June 2002] Man, I got to update this thing more often! People were starting to worry and believe that I'm permanently depressed, going to kill myself or... I can assure you that frankly I don't have enough time to spend on being depressed. Any residual boredom went away when my music project ("Bored In Auxburg") was starting to eat more and more of my spare time and financial resources - no end in sight. What comes out of it is still not exactly what I want it to be, but I'm having lots of fun - only recently with this (removed due to server space limit) track, for instance "Caffeine"- MP3, 3765104 bytes . [June 2003] Another year went by. Still around. New track (And yes this is _me_ singing!) Will post more as I get them done and people continue to actually listen to this stuff... I am still maintaining my freeware DOS- extender- project. If you came here because of that - click here to get to the WDOSX pages. So that was basically it so far. You can contact me via email or on ICQ 123799232
