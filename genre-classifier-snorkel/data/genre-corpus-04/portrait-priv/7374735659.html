<H3>Research activities</H3>

Örjan Ekeberg has been involved in the development of both artificial
and biological neural network models with an emphasis on the
integration of these two lines of research.  His thesis work was on
biologically realistic computer simulation techniques used in the
study of swimming patterns.  Parts this work was done in close
collaboration with the <A
HREF="http://www.neuro.ki.se/neuro/div8.html">Nobel Institute for
Neurophysiology</A> at <A HREF="http://www.ki.se">Karolinska
Institutet</A>, Stockholm.  He has developed a number of simulation
packages for numerical neuronal simulations, in particular the SWIM
simulator, currently used by several neurophysiology departments in
Sweden and abroad.  He is now developing the techniques to do the
integrated neuro-mechanical simulations necessary when studying the
neuronal control systems that operate in close contact with the
environment.
